        "article": "It was a call that changed his life. After a decade without speaking to her, Dan Watson was contacted by his mother Lynn from Ireland last year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer. The 34 year old Sydney man resolved to turn over a new leaf after hearing the shocking news and decided to hike a staggering 5,000 kilometres across Australia for charity. \u2018I was in a bad place at the time. I realised the only way I was going to make it through the other end of the tunnel was to do something selfless. I had to put others first,\u2019 Dan told Daily Mail Australia. Dan Watson, 34, has embarked upon a 5000km solo mega-walk from Perth to Sydney with nothing but a custom made trolley to carry the bare necessities . Watson resolved to make the journey after he spoke with his mother Lynn (pictured) after a decade without contact . In a bid to repair his relationship with his mother, Dan embarked on the inspiring mega-walk from Fremantle to Sydney to raise money for the Cancer Council NSW and national mental health charity SANE. \u2018My mother phoned last year from Ireland to say she needed me. She was going through her third round of chemotherapy. I knew it was very serious,\u2019 he said. The Sydney advertising worker said he had blamed his parents for the anxiety and depression that has plagued him throughout his life, but the walk offered him a means of mending his familial fences. \u2018The thought of losing out on the chance to settle our differences made me sick to my bones. I needed to show her I still cared.\u2019 Watson arrives to Melbourne with 'Blue Steele', a trolley his friends named to give it more personal value . Watson said he had to remind himself that while trip was physically exhausting, it was trivial compared to what his mother was enduring . Dan said the biggest hurdle of the walk was the Nullarbor Desert, a vast and barren swathe of land in South Australia . Before starting the journey, Dan had a custom built trolley made to cart necessities like clothing and food. 'My friends named it Blue Steele. That way it had a human quality and I was more likely to look after it.' He said the biggest hurdle of the walk, which is set to come to a close this weekend when he arrives at Bondi Beach, was the Nullarbor Desert - a vast and barren swathe of land in southern Australia. \u2018It's extremely arid and hot. Towards the end of the desert I began to lose my nerve. I was famished, as there were virtually no supermarkets for food.\u2019 \u2018I started to get this foreboding feeling of regret, that it was all a waste. I just about lost my marbles. 'But I had to tell myself it was only temporary, that my suffering was trivial compared to what my mum was going through.\u2019 Dan said he lost over 20kgs over the journey and was left 'looking like a malnourished marathon runner' He is set to complete the mammoth hike this Sunday when he arrives at Bondi Beach . Watson said he expects to reach his goal of raising 20,000 for the Cancer Foundation NSW and SANE, a national mental health charity . While he was lean going into the journey, Dan said he lost over 20kgs. \u2018I began the journey at about 77kg. By the end of the Nullabar I was about 55kg. I looked like a malnourished marathon runner,\u2019 he said. He expects to reach his goal of raising $20,000 when he completes the mammoth hike this Sunday at Bondi Beach.

        "article": "Roger Clemens will not have to pay Brian McNamee a dime after a settlement was reached in the defamation lawsuit that was brought against the former MLB pitcher by his ex-trainer\u00a0in 2008. The terms of the settlement call for an undisclosed amount of money to be paid by the former Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees pitcher's insurer AIG. The deal will not require the seven-time Cy Young Award winner to contribute any money or release any claims against McNamee, attorneys for both men said on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Roger Clemens' insurer AIG will pay his ex-trainer Brian McNamee an undisclosed sum after a court settlement . The deal that that was reached in the defamation lawsuit will not require Clemens, 52, to contribute any money . The 2008 lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee (pictured above) McNamee sued Clemens, 52, for defamation in 2008 after the pitcher said McNamee lied and manufactured evidence when he accused the pitcher of using banned performance-enhancing drugs . That lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee after the onetime strength coach told federal agents and Congress he routinely injected the hard-throwing right-hander with steroids and human growth hormone from 1998 through 2001. Clemens, who pitched until he was 45, has denied the charges and told ESPN McNamee's case was an example of 'somebody out there that is really crawling up your back to make a buck.' Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards in his career . The resolution to the long-running dispute was reached after closed-door negotiations before US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak in Brooklyn. The case was moved to federal court in 2009. Clemens didn't attend the settlement talks. His lawyer, Chip Babcock, said AIG negotiated the settlement with McNamee, according to the New York Daily News. Babcock said last month: 'If the insurance company wants to pay Mr McNamee, there is not much I can do about that.' McNamee's attorney Richard Emery said the agreement was fair and allowed everyone involved to move on. He said: 'At this point it's water over the dam. 'It's high time. This is old news these days.' Clemens, who also plitched for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Houston Astros in his two-decade-long career, was found not guilty in 2012 of charges of obstructing Congress, making false statements in a deposition and committing perjury when he denied using steroids or human growth hormone injected by McNamee. After the deal was reached, McNamee told reporters it hadn't sunk in yet. He said: 'I got to digest this. 'I got to go home and have a good meal. Let me sit with it.' Clemens has a homeowner's insurance policy with AIG. A spokesman the insurer declined to comment.",

        "summary": "More than 2,000 people have had tattoos removed by NHS since 2010 .\nThe cost of the laser treatment is more than \u00a3330,000, figures reveal .\nMPs last night slammed the expenditure as a 'sheer waste' of NHS funds .",
        "article": "The NHS has spent nearly \u00a3350,000 on removing tattoos after people changed their minds about their body art. More than 2,000 people have been given free laser treatment \u2013 courtesy of the taxpayer \u2013 in the past four years, described by MPs as a \u2018sheer waste\u2019 of scarce NHS funds. Tattoo removal is not routinely provided by the NHS, but guidance states it can be carried out \u2018to protect a person\u2019s health\u2019 if their doctor believes it is causing them \u2018significant distress or serious mental health problems\u2019. The NHS has spent \u00a3350,000 on removing people's tattoos for them once they have second thoughts (file image) It would also be considered if the dye had caused a \u2018significant allergic reaction or infection\u2019 or if someone had been tattooed against their will. A patient must be referred by their GP. Figures obtained by The Sun under Freedom of Information laws show 2,016 people had tattoos removed since 2010 at a cost of \u00a3330,182. However, the true cost is likely to be much higher, as many trusts did not provide breakdowns of the reasons for laser treatments. The number of tattoo parlours in the UK has soared from about 50 in the 1970s to 1,000 today. Their popularity has been boosted by celebrity fans, including David Beckham and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Even the Prime Minister\u2019s wife, Samantha Cameron, has a small dolphin tattoo on her ankle. However, four in ten people are said to regret having a tattoo and one in six want them removed. Laser removal uses beams of different coloured light to break down the ink into minuscule fragments, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the liver and digestive system. The popularity of tattoos has been boosted by celebrity fans, including David Beckham (pictured), Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and even Samantha Cameron . Private clinics charge around \u00a3150 a session for a small tattoo and up to \u00a3800 for a larger one. Typically eight to ten sessions are needed for large tattoos. One patient to benefit was John, 22, who had a large swastika removed from his chest and hoped to have other Nazi symbols removed from his back and arms. He told the BBC he wanted them removed so he could move abroad and take his top off while working out. He added: \u2018You can\u2019t really do that with something that is going to offend everybody... I want to move on in life. If I got them removed I\u2019d be able to change my image.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018Taxpayers will be furious that they\u2019re funding what amounts to cosmetic surgery. You can\u2019t go a day in politics without someone calling for more money for the NHS, but it\u2019s clear that too much is already wasted. \u2018With Britain\u2019s finances so stretched we have to prioritise spending on essential services, not on covering up ill-advised body art.\u2019 Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: \u2018People will struggle to see how this sheer waste of precious NHS money can be justified when hospitals do not have enough staff. \u2018Patient care is already heading downhill and more nurses could be lost under Tory spending cuts.\u2019",

        "article": "Nico Rosberg has vowed to avoid a repeat of the pain of Formula One world championship defeat to Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton this season. A wheel has yet to turn in anger in the new season but the expectation already is that Mercedes will continue to dominate. It means the fight for the drivers' crown is likely to be a further showdown between reigning champion Hamilton and his team-mate Rosberg. Nico Rosberg is determined to gain revenge on his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton and win the Formula One drivers' championship in the 2015 season, which gets underway in Melbourne this weekend . Rosberg and Hamilton will once again have the strongest car on the grid this season . Last year Hamilton reeled in Rosberg's early advantage with a run of six victories in the final seven races to clinch his second title. Rosberg, though, is determined to gain revenge as the 29-year-old German said: 'I have focused on pushing myself even harder for the rematch with Lewis. 'In the end, it comes down to who can put the best season together overall, and I have to make sure it's the other way around this time. 'Having said that, my team-mate is one of many strong competitors I have to beat if I want to be world champion, so I'm just focused on being the absolute best I can be. Rosberg tries out the new Mercedes car during Winter Testing at the Circuit de Catalunya last week . Rosberg sits in his car ahead of a test run in Barcelona at the end of last month . 'I now know the feeling of winning races and I intend to do a lot more of that, but I also know the feeling of not winning in the end and I don't intend to repeat that experience. 'It's a huge motivation for me and gives me even more determination for 2015.' Hamilton is equally fired up to write his name into F1 folklore and join a rare breed of three-times champions. 'There are many good drivers out there and all of them want to win - you just have to want it more than they do,' said Hamilton. 'I feel fresh, I feel fit, I feel relaxed, I feel positive...I feel ready. 'As a driver you get stronger with every season, so I plan to be better than last year.'",

Police are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping high street shoppers if they sneeze. In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man, who wears a tweed jacket, first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday. The following day, the same man is thought to have slapped an 82-year-old woman who had just sneezed in Scotch Street, Carlisle. Sgt Gill Cherry of Cumbria Police said the pensioner was left feeling 'confused and upset'. Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses \u2013 but have yet to trace the victim. Cumbrian Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket. The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them. Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

Shoppers in Carlisle yesterday said they were concerned by the eccentric's behaviour, although Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, said:\u00a0'I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold. 'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back. 'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.' Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird. 'When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault.' Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked'",

        "summary": "Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .\nShafqat Hussain was convicted at age 14; his family says confession extracted under torture .",
        "article": "Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. \"We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,\" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. \"We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need.\" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. \"He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife.\" \"I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing.\" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. \"It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,\" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. \"Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society.\" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to \"reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial.\" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant \"that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\"\u200b .",

        "article": "An unruly wind swirled around Haifa on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mediterranean flying. It seemed a fittingly uncomfortable Middle Eastern welcome for Wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance. Here in the Holy Land, Wales want to take a step closer to their long-sought grail: qualification for a major tournament. Not since the 1958 World Cup have they been to a finals competition. Wales midfielder Gareth Bale stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday . WALES (probable, 5-3-1-1): Hennessey; Gunter, Collins, Williams, Davies, Taylor; Ramsey, Allen, Ledley; Bale; Vokes. ISRAEL (probable, 4-3-3): Marciano; Dgani, Ben Haim I, Tibi, Ben Harush; Yeini, Natcho, Refaelov; Ben Haim II, Zahavi, Damari. Israel host Chris Coleman\u2019s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides\u2019 aspirations of reaching Euro 2016. It is first against second in Group B. Coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly-built Sammy Ofer Stadium, which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical Israel supporters, as well as 900 from Wales. Those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign, two wins and two draws, the last point in Belgium a hugely encouraging display and result. Israel have three wins from three, and beat Bosnia 3-0 in their last home game. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by Wales, though. Victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in France nearer into view. Defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent. Coleman is aware of the importance of this tie, calling it Wales\u2019 biggest since the Euro 2004 play-off against Russia. He hopes to be saying the same when Belgium come to Cardiff in June, but that can only be the case with a positive result here. The Wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed, at either end of his Wales playing career. In 1993 a missed spot-kick against Romania proved decisive, in 2003 it was an inability to score past Russia over two legs. Coleman spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game. \u2018I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it,\u2019 he said. \u2018I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . \u2018We have a good current group, we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go.\u2019 His opposition manager Eli Guttman was in jovial mood, making sarcastic remarks about calling Cristiano Ronaldo for advice and insisting Gareth Bale must be worth his \u00a386million fee because Real Madrid paid it. Coleman struck a different chord. \u2018I feel focused,\u2019 he said. \u2018I am looking forward to it. We have had a real good week of preparation. I am nervous, excited. Any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie. \u2018All we can do is focus on performance and the plan. That has been the secret of our success so far.\u2019 Having Bale in your midst must provide a comfort blanket, even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from Madrid. The 25-year-old loves playing for his country, where he is among long-term friends. No-one belts out the national anthem louder. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . He has not scored in three internationals, but dragged Wales to victory in Andorra in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone, scoring a retaken free-kick nine minutes from time. Bale is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5-3-2 formation mooted. But Israel will start right back Orel Dgani for the first time and Coleman said he would explore Bale\u2019s position as the match took shape. \u2018If there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019ve changed tactically during a match before.\u2019 It is not all about Bale. Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams are elite players operating in the Premier League. Williams will win his 50th cap. There is youth, but experience. Coleman acknowledged Israel\u2019s potency in attack, with RB Leipzig\u2019s Omer Damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification, level with Danny Welbeck. No player has more. Tal Ben Haim, once of Chelsea, Manchester City and Bolton, is the most recognisable name in Israel\u2019s line-up. He wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the Sammy Ofer than the one that stunned Bosnia. \u2018I know British football but it will not make it easier for me,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against Wales the atmosphere will be even better.\u2019",

They may not have the business information so they\u2019ll come to me for the business data.\u2019 Moulton College writes in an online testimonial that it bought 10,000 records from Data Bubble and as a result \u2018our February Open Day was the busiest one we\u2019d had for some time\u2019. Marketing director Andrea Hughes admitted the data was bought to target children. \u2018\u2018We... purchased a list of parents of Year 11 children within a ten-mile radius of the college,\u2019 she said. \u2018We had no cause for concern around Data Bubble and believe the mailing was successful.We have no plans to use Data Bubble again.\u2019 Undercover reporters from the Mail also contacted data broker Prospect360. With Data Bubble, it was one of three firms whose names were passed to the paper as having sold personal information on pensioners which ended up in the hands of people suspected of being involved in a major fraud. Mr Mishra revealed that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was one of his clients . He boasted that the Government had commissioned his firm to create and send out hundreds of thousands of emails under a scheme, to help small businesses at a cost of \u2018ten, fifteen thousand pounds\u2019 Asked where they obtained the firms\u2019 email addresses, Mr Mishra said call centres phoned receptionists to ask for information . Prospect360 managing director Vidya Mishra offered to sell personal pensions data for as little as 5p a time and spoke of the benefits of targeting the vulnerable when making cold calls. Mr Mishra, whose wife is a dentist, also claimed he sells data to NHS dentists so they can target poor people, who are more likely to have poor teeth. Dentists then allegedly try to convince the patients to pay for private follow up treatments. Mr Mishra, 44, revealed that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was one of his clients. He boasted that the Government had commissioned his firm to create and send out hundreds of thousands of emails under a scheme, to help small businesses at a cost of \u2018ten, fifteen thousand pounds\u2019. Asked where they obtained the firms\u2019 email addresses, Mr Mishra said call centres phoned receptionists to ask for information. Warwickshire College admits online that it has used Data Bubble \u2018again and again\u2019 and \u2018have no hesitation in recommending them\u2019 but said yesterday it \u2018will await the outcome of the investigation by the ICO\u2019 before deciding whether to use them again. City of Wolverhampton College said: \u2018No details other than names and addresses of people who might be interested in further study were requested or obtained. The college has no plans to use this organisation\u2019s services in the future.\u2019 The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the deal with Prospect360 was arranged through a third party. It would not comment on the amount of taxpayers\u2019 money it spent. Mrs Clayton said: \u2018We are a reputable data broker who supplies data legally. It is our responsibility as a data broker to supply data within the laws and regulations surrounding our industry and we take those responsibilities very seriously.\u2019 Mr Mishra said: \u2018We buy and supply data in good faith. We never do anything underhand and we never misguide people.\u2019",

        "article": "Glasgow could yet host Britain\u2019s glamour Davis Cup quarter-final with France in July \u2013 if Team GB opt to put atmosphere ahead of a desire to play on grass. Andy Murray led the home team to victory over USA in front of 7,500 passionate fans at the Emirates Arena on Sunday and, with all three days sold out in a matter of minutes, there is an obvious desire to see Scotland\u2019s greatest active sportsman in action again. Murray himself expressed a preference for facing the French on grass \u2013 but said: \u2018I think grass might be a good surface, but we\u2019ll have to see, because playing in front of a crowd like this also makes a difference and it helps. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . If we can\u2019t guarantee that at a grass venue maybe it makes sense to play it somewhere we can get that.\u2019 GB captain Leon Smith, a Glaswegian himself, said there was \u2018no chance\u2019 of finding or creating a suitably large outdoor venue \u2013 a minimum of 600 seats are required \u2013 in order to bring a grass-court tie to Scotland. But he added: \u2018I say no chance but I\u2019m not a lawn expert. So, if someone can tell me there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019m sure we would explore it. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue . Smith embraces with \u00a0Murray after the latter's straight sets win secured GB's quarter-final berth . Murray (middle) is looked on in envy by his fellow GB team-mates after securing a tie against France . 'Internally, we\u2019ve looked at other options, thinking outside the box. \u2018The first thing I need to do, over the next week or two, is think about the best surface. Andy said grass there but we need to sit as a group, look at the likely French team and think about what\u2019s best. \u2018Then we have to go somewhere with a great atmosphere. If it\u2019s indoor hard, why not here \u2013 or somewhere near here? Something like this, it definitely worked in Scotland. 'You have to look at when the tie lands in the summer, too. \u2018There will have been an awful lot of tennis in certain regions, so you want to put it somewhere people have the hunger for more tennis. We\u2019ll be phoning around like mad. \u2018Ultimately you go with the surface that gives you the best chance of winning. The atmosphere is great \u2013 but it will be even better to be in the semi-finals. \u2018We\u2019ve got to pick a surface that all the players agree on. We\u2019ll put our heads together over the next week, then go to the suits and ask them to make it happen.\u2019",
