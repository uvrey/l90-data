Crime behind bars: Damien Miller will spend another ten years in jail after he masterminded a heroin and cocaine racket from his cell . A drugs baron will spend another ten years behind bars for masterminding another heroin and cocaine racket from his prison cell. Damien Miller, 31, was serving seven years for supplying drugs to his home city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire yet he began a new criminal enterprise when he being transferred to an open prison. Whilst on day release from North Sea Camp Prison in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices. He then formed a new gang which peddled drugs in Stoke-on-Trent whilst he served out the rest of his stretch over 120 miles away. He even managed to pay \u00a315,000 from drug dealing into his own bank account. Police began investigating after noticing a rise in violent organised crime in Stoke and discovered Miller was the ringleader. They alerted bosses at the jail and began a surveillance operation and discovered that he was organising new drugs deals. John Phillips, 29, was Miller\u2019s \u2018right-hand man\u2019 in Stoke-on-Trent and controlled the day-to-day running of the drug crime while Miller remained in behind bars in Lincolnshire where he was said to be building a \u2018comfortable life\u2019 from the profits. Police arrested in Miller in June last year after seizing more than 2.2lbs of heroin and cocaine worth around \u00a3100,000 and using mobile phone records to link low-level couriers to Miller and Phillips. At Stafford Crown Court in Knutton, Miller admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Phillips of Stoke, was jailed for seven and a half years and another seven men and two women were jailed for a total of 23 years. Passing sentence Judge Michael Cullum told Miller today: \u2018You had a role which was highly significant or borderline leading. \u2018Clearly you conducted this enterprise while held at an open prison. This is a seriously aggravating feature.\u2019 Former businessman Miller was initially jailed in 2009 after heading an operation to supply the dealers of Stoke with 2.2lbs of cocaine worth up to \u00a388,000 which he bought from a Liverpool wholesale dealer. New criminal enterprise: While on day release from North Sea Camp Prison (pictured) in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices . He claimed he was \u2018not an organiser\u2019 and was acting \u2018under orders\u2019 and had once fled to Spain fearing he was about to be assassinated. But police began investigating him again in 2011 after reports of wide scale drug dealing in the city. Between March and June police carried out a series of raids and intercepted deliveries of varying amounts of cocaine, heroin and cash. After each seizure of drugs, police observed increased contact between Miller, Phillips and other accomplices. Over the course of the investigation, police seized more than 2.2lbs of cocaine and heroin from the conspirators. Miller deposited \u00a315,000 in his bank account over the three month period, while Phillips\u2019 income totalled \u00a32,680. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Clews, head of Staffordshire Police\u2019s Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: \u2018Building a case against Miller, Phillips and their associates took a considerable team effort involving several agencies and police departments. Miles away: Miller began building a 'comfortable life' from the profits of the drug ring while in the open prison . New gang peddling drugs:\u00a0 John Phillips (right) was Miller's 'right hand man', controlling the day-to-day running of the drug crime and and was convicted along with seven men, including Dane Parker (left), and two women to over the enterprise . \u2018Miller did not handle the drugs himself, but got other people to do his dirty work for him. As head of the group he was controlling everyone, and everything, from a distance. \u2018But by piecing together a series of events we were able to uncover Miller\u2019s involvement and the extent of his crime, along with that of all the others involved. \u2018We gathered evidence of events which led to cash and drugs being recovered. We have CCTV footage of Phillips meeting Miller at a pub in Nottingham. All aspects of Miller\u2019s life in Lincolnshire were thoroughly investigated. \u2018This case has also shown that some of those involved in this Organised Crime Group were vulnerable individuals who were easily manipulated by Miller and Phillips. People like this, who are so easily exploited by criminals, end up paying a high price.\u2019 Governor of North Sea Camp Prison, Graham Batchford, said: \u2018We are not complacent about prisoners who breach their licence conditions. \u2018Today\u2019s outcome is proof that we will take every measure possible, including working close with the police, to ensure that those who fall foul of the terms of their temporary release are swiftly brought to justice.\u2019 Dane Parker, 23, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and conspiracy to money launder. He was jailed for three years, eight months. Scott Mosedale, 26, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was sentenced to two years, eight months. 'Borderline leading': While Miller claimed he was not 'an organiser' and was acting 'under orders', Judge Michael Cullum said in Stafford Crown Court (pictured) today that he had clearly conducted the enterprise while in an open prison . Ryan Jones, 27, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted possessing criminal property and conspiracy to money launder. He received a sentence of one year, two months. Stephanie Pitchford, 22, and Kerry Wilkinson, 25, both of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. They were sentenced to two years and one year, eight months respectively. Anthony Bostock, 32, of Stoke-on-Trent, . admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. He has been jailed for two years, . three months. Byron Dunkley, 21, of Stafford, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He has gone to prison for 16 months. Otis Fox, aged 22, a serving prisoner, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and the possession of criminal property. He denied conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was sentenced to three years, three months. Liam Myatt, 22, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. He was jailed for three years.

Gunmen who shot a middle-aged mother and her son in a terrifying targeted attack outside a bingo hall were being hunted by police today. Scott Calder, 22, and his 56-year-old mother Marie were caught in a hail of bullets after they were ambushed in a car park outside the Gala Bingo branch. Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder, who uses the nickname 'The Demon' on his Facebook page, was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire. Scene: Police search the car park outside the Gala Bingo in Harpurhey, Manchester, where 22-year-old Scott Calder and his 56-year-old mother Marie were shot .

Detectives were also believed to be investigating reports of a dispute between Mr Calder and other members of the family. Ms Calder and her son were attacked shortly after Mr Calder arrived at the car park outside the bingo hall to pick her up at around 7.15pm last night. Moments later, a black car pulled up behind the family, blocking them in the car park outside the Harpurhey branch of chain Gala Bingo in Manchester. Probe: A police cordon remained around the scene today as officers continued to investigate the shooting . Two men then climbed out of the car and fired a number of shots at the Mr Calder's Audi. One bullet hit Ms Calder in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack. Mr Calder managed to get out of the car park and abandoned his car in a nearby street before he and his injured mother staggered to hospital. The nearest hospital, North Manchester General, is about a half-hour walk away. Doctors then called police to investigate the shooting. Neither injury was believed to be life-threatening. The incident occurred in the gritty Manchester district of Harpurhey where controversial BBC Three reality TV show People Like Us was based - and which was critically panned for showing a stereotypical view of the locals. Just minutes before the shooting Mr . Calder posted a message on his Facebook page saying: 'Stab me in the . back, I'll blast ur spine.' Another posted on January 5 said: 'n this game there's only one don' and on Jan 9 he wrote: 'Even if I died young who cares.' Today the injured man posted a series of messages about the shooting - the first saying: 'In hospital bin shot.' He . sent another message later saying: 'Bin woke up for operation to get da . bullet out ma hand. Goin for ma operation, nuff love to everyone.' His . sister Jessica left a message saying: 'My mum's a soldier so is my . brother. Hope my mums [sic] ok i love u loads x x x x strongest women in the . worldx.' One local said: \"It . is shocking and terrifying to think this happened outside a bingo hall. Scott is very well known in the locality and it's terrible to think his . mum has been shot after being unwittingly caught up in some kind of . dispute.' Wellwishers went . onto Calder's Facebook page to pass on goodwill messages. Chantelle . Livesey said: 'Hope everything ok scott and your poor mum x.' Levi . Mcdade said: 'Hope everything is okay and Same to your mum x.' Ambush: One bullet hit the mother in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack, which took place at around 7.15pm . The scene of the shooting, at the rear of Asda in front of Harpurhay Market was cordoned off by police tape and several officers were seen patrolling the area. Seven cars remain in the cordoned-off car park. Detective Superintendent Alex Millet said: 'This appears to be a targeted incident which could have had even more dire consequences. 'Thankfully it doesn\u2019t look like either are too seriously injured, but we\u2019ll know more tomorrow. Well-wishers: Scott Calder told his friends via Facebook that he had been shot, prompting messages of support . Operation: Mr Calder told his friends he had received surgery for the bullet wound to his wrist . 'We believe the black car was driven by two white men and it\u2019s from that car that the shots were fired. 'I want to reassure people that we have had armed response officers to the scene and are now investigating.' A spokesman from Greater Manchester Police said he could not disclose why the pair might have been targeted."

Adventurous parents could soon be able to take their toddlers out on skateboarding trips with them . It will also mean parents will be able to take their . children out on much longer 'walks' they can with a normal stroller. The product has been created by design studio Studio Peter . Van Riet in Antwerp, Belgium, for buggy brand Quinny. Inventors behind the Longboardstroller hope it will be an . environmentally friendly alternative to travelling in cities and that parents . will choose it over a car or bus. Around eight prototypes of the product have been invented . and it is currently being tested and evaluated for health and safety measures. Peter Van Riet, 42, owner of Studio Peter Van Riet, said: 'Last year we were approached by Quinny and they had an idea to make a . stroller you could stand on. 'We met with parents o talk about it and came up with . the idea of a stroller combined with a long board.

Children between the ages of nine months and four-and-a-half years old can comfortably sit in the buggy . 'With just a stroller alone you can travel maybe half a . mile and this offers a solution to go further without having to use a car or . another form of transport. 'It's also environmentally friendly which is one of the . main points behind it. 'To make the prototype we used part of an existing . stroller and had a longboard made out of wood and fibreglass to make it . stronger. 'It can hold children from about nine-months-old up to . four-and-a-half years, with a maximum weight of around 2st 7lbs. 'Adults stand on the back and use the handles to steer . or they can lean from side to side which also changes the direction. 'We are currently thinking about safety features such . as what kind of brake it needs, how to attach the children and board sizes. 'It is difficult to say how much it will cost as it is . not for sale yet but a good longboard costs up to \u00a3300 so it will be a bit . more than that with the extra parts.' The product has also been enhanced with a brake at the back and handlebars for steering ."
