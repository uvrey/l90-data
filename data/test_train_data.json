        "article": "Playing computer games such as Angry Birds teaches children important life skills including concentration, resilience and problem solving, an academic has said. Professor Angela Mcfarlane, an education expert who will become head of training body the College of Teachers next month, said many games were complex and required deep learning and lateral thinking to solve them. Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on the Lemmings computer game, as well as Angry Birds, and said such games could have a place in the classroom provided they were used under supervision. Professor Angela Mcfarlane says computer games like Angry Birds can teach children valuable life-skills . Expert: Prof Mcfarlane says the games can help children learn problem solving, resilience and concentration . She said: 'There are many computer games that require quite deep learning to master the games. 'Some of that learning applies beyond games to wider life, such as concentration, problem solving, and resilience - important life skills. 'Anyone who has tried to play complex video games will know they are difficult.' Speaking to The Times, Prof Mcfarlane said she had developed an obsession with both Angry Birds and a precursor, Lemmings, because they had made her think and get her strategy right. The education expert, who has advised the government on educational technology, and who is currently writing a book, Authentic Learning for the Digital Generation, said computer games could be used in the classroom to good effect provided it was done properly. Prof Mcfarlane said even pre-school children could benefit from games, as long as they were supervised and not just given a phone to play with to keep them quiet. Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on a computer game called Lemmings, pictured . She said some games could teach children fine motor control, or help with vocabulary or simple maths, and taught skills such as resilience that could be applicable to real life. Next month Prof Mcfarlane, who began her career as a secondary school teacher and head of department, will become chief executive and registrar of the College of Teachers, which offers professional training to teachers and support staff.",

Crime behind bars: Damien Miller will spend another ten years in jail after he masterminded a heroin and cocaine racket from his cell . A drugs baron will spend another ten years behind bars for masterminding another heroin and cocaine racket from his prison cell. Damien Miller, 31, was serving seven years for supplying drugs to his home city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire yet he began a new criminal enterprise when he being transferred to an open prison. Whilst on day release from North Sea Camp Prison in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices. He then formed a new gang which peddled drugs in Stoke-on-Trent whilst he served out the rest of his stretch over 120 miles away. He even managed to pay \u00a315,000 from drug dealing into his own bank account. Police began investigating after noticing a rise in violent organised crime in Stoke and discovered Miller was the ringleader. They alerted bosses at the jail and began a surveillance operation and discovered that he was organising new drugs deals. John Phillips, 29, was Miller\u2019s \u2018right-hand man\u2019 in Stoke-on-Trent and controlled the day-to-day running of the drug crime while Miller remained in behind bars in Lincolnshire where he was said to be building a \u2018comfortable life\u2019 from the profits. Police arrested in Miller in June last year after seizing more than 2.2lbs of heroin and cocaine worth around \u00a3100,000 and using mobile phone records to link low-level couriers to Miller and Phillips. At Stafford Crown Court in Knutton, Miller admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Phillips of Stoke, was jailed for seven and a half years and another seven men and two women were jailed for a total of 23 years. Passing sentence Judge Michael Cullum told Miller today: \u2018You had a role which was highly significant or borderline leading. \u2018Clearly you conducted this enterprise while held at an open prison. This is a seriously aggravating feature.\u2019 Former businessman Miller was initially jailed in 2009 after heading an operation to supply the dealers of Stoke with 2.2lbs of cocaine worth up to \u00a388,000 which he bought from a Liverpool wholesale dealer. New criminal enterprise: While on day release from North Sea Camp Prison (pictured) in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices . He claimed he was \u2018not an organiser\u2019 and was acting \u2018under orders\u2019 and had once fled to Spain fearing he was about to be assassinated. But police began investigating him again in 2011 after reports of wide scale drug dealing in the city. Between March and June police carried out a series of raids and intercepted deliveries of varying amounts of cocaine, heroin and cash. After each seizure of drugs, police observed increased contact between Miller, Phillips and other accomplices. Over the course of the investigation, police seized more than 2.2lbs of cocaine and heroin from the conspirators. Miller deposited \u00a315,000 in his bank account over the three month period, while Phillips\u2019 income totalled \u00a32,680. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Clews, head of Staffordshire Police\u2019s Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: \u2018Building a case against Miller, Phillips and their associates took a considerable team effort involving several agencies and police departments. Miles away: Miller began building a 'comfortable life' from the profits of the drug ring while in the open prison . New gang peddling drugs:\u00a0 John Phillips (right) was Miller's 'right hand man', controlling the day-to-day running of the drug crime and and was convicted along with seven men, including Dane Parker (left), and two women to over the enterprise . \u2018Miller did not handle the drugs himself, but got other people to do his dirty work for him. As head of the group he was controlling everyone, and everything, from a distance. \u2018But by piecing together a series of events we were able to uncover Miller\u2019s involvement and the extent of his crime, along with that of all the others involved. \u2018We gathered evidence of events which led to cash and drugs being recovered. We have CCTV footage of Phillips meeting Miller at a pub in Nottingham. All aspects of Miller\u2019s life in Lincolnshire were thoroughly investigated. \u2018This case has also shown that some of those involved in this Organised Crime Group were vulnerable individuals who were easily manipulated by Miller and Phillips. People like this, who are so easily exploited by criminals, end up paying a high price.\u2019 Governor of North Sea Camp Prison, Graham Batchford, said: \u2018We are not complacent about prisoners who breach their licence conditions. \u2018Today\u2019s outcome is proof that we will take every measure possible, including working close with the police, to ensure that those who fall foul of the terms of their temporary release are swiftly brought to justice.\u2019 Dane Parker, 23, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and conspiracy to money launder. He was jailed for three years, eight months. Scott Mosedale, 26, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was sentenced to two years, eight months. 'Borderline leading': While Miller claimed he was not 'an organiser' and was acting 'under orders', Judge Michael Cullum said in Stafford Crown Court (pictured) today that he had clearly conducted the enterprise while in an open prison . Ryan Jones, 27, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted possessing criminal property and conspiracy to money launder. He received a sentence of one year, two months. Stephanie Pitchford, 22, and Kerry Wilkinson, 25, both of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. They were sentenced to two years and one year, eight months respectively. Anthony Bostock, 32, of Stoke-on-Trent, . admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. He has been jailed for two years, . three months. Byron Dunkley, 21, of Stafford, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He has gone to prison for 16 months. Otis Fox, aged 22, a serving prisoner, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and the possession of criminal property. He denied conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was sentenced to three years, three months. Liam Myatt, 22, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. He was jailed for three years.

Gunmen who shot a middle-aged mother and her son in a terrifying targeted attack outside a bingo hall were being hunted by police today. Scott Calder, 22, and his 56-year-old mother Marie were caught in a hail of bullets after they were ambushed in a car park outside the Gala Bingo branch. Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder, who uses the nickname 'The Demon' on his Facebook page, was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire. Scene: Police search the car park outside the Gala Bingo in Harpurhey, Manchester, where 22-year-old Scott Calder and his 56-year-old mother Marie were shot . Target: Detectives were today working on the theory that Mr Calder was the intended target of the shooting, and his mother was caught in the crossfire . Detectives were also believed to be investigating reports of a dispute between Mr Calder and other members of the family. Ms Calder and her son were attacked shortly after Mr Calder arrived at the car park outside the bingo hall to pick her up at around 7.15pm last night. Moments later, a black car pulled up behind the family, blocking them in the car park outside the Harpurhey branch of chain Gala Bingo in Manchester. Probe: A police cordon remained around the scene today as officers continued to investigate the shooting . Two men then climbed out of the car and fired a number of shots at the Mr Calder's Audi. One bullet hit Ms Calder in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack. Mr Calder managed to get out of the car park and abandoned his car in a nearby street before he and his injured mother staggered to hospital. The nearest hospital, North Manchester General, is about a half-hour walk away. Doctors then called police to investigate the shooting. Neither injury was believed to be life-threatening. The incident occurred in the gritty Manchester district of Harpurhey where controversial BBC Three reality TV show People Like Us was based - and which was critically panned for showing a stereotypical view of the locals. Just minutes before the shooting Mr . Calder posted a message on his Facebook page saying: 'Stab me in the . back, I'll blast ur spine.' Another posted on January 5 said: 'n this game there's only one don' and on Jan 9 he wrote: 'Even if I died young who cares.' Today the injured man posted a series of messages about the shooting - the first saying: 'In hospital bin shot.' He . sent another message later saying: 'Bin woke up for operation to get da . bullet out ma hand. Goin for ma operation, nuff love to everyone.' His . sister Jessica left a message saying: 'My mum's a soldier so is my . brother. Hope my mums [sic] ok i love u loads x x x x strongest women in the . worldx.' One local said: \"It . is shocking and terrifying to think this happened outside a bingo hall. Scott is very well known in the locality and it's terrible to think his . mum has been shot after being unwittingly caught up in some kind of . dispute.' Wellwishers went . onto Calder's Facebook page to pass on goodwill messages. Chantelle . Livesey said: 'Hope everything ok scott and your poor mum x.' Levi . Mcdade said: 'Hope everything is okay and Same to your mum x.' Ambush: One bullet hit the mother in the elbow, while her son was shot in the wrist in the attack, which took place at around 7.15pm . The scene of the shooting, at the rear of Asda in front of Harpurhay Market was cordoned off by police tape and several officers were seen patrolling the area. Seven cars remain in the cordoned-off car park. Detective Superintendent Alex Millet said: 'This appears to be a targeted incident which could have had even more dire consequences. 'Thankfully it doesn\u2019t look like either are too seriously injured, but we\u2019ll know more tomorrow. Well-wishers: Scott Calder told his friends via Facebook that he had been shot, prompting messages of support . Operation: Mr Calder told his friends he had received surgery for the bullet wound to his wrist .

        "article": "By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 7:26 PM on 6th October 2011 . They fought, and suffered terrible injuries, on battlefields across the world. Now 300 wounded or emotionally-traumatised soldiers will have a little piece of Britain to call their own. A pioneering \u00a327million veterans' village is set to be built on a 55-acre site in the scenic countryside. Pioneering: A new retreat is being built for injured veterans and will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility (2), 200 bungalows (7), a leisure centre (3) and a donkey sanctuary (11) The village will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility, 200 bungalows, leisure centre with swimming pool, social club, lakes, woodland walks and a donkey sanctuary. In a first of its kind in the UK, its population will almost entirely be made up of former troops who have suffered horrific physical or psychological injuries on the battlefield. A large number of servicemen and women will have been badly-wounded in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The project, dreamed up by the Veteran's Retreat charity, would be built on a former tileworks close to the hamlet of Newlands, Northumberland, and the village of Ebchester, County Durham. The trustees will seek planning permission in December and hope to open the first homes and care facility late next year. Despite concerns from local residents that the new development will blight the countryside, the charity points out that it is on a brown-field site that housed a factory. The veterans' village will also create up to 500 jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment and pump money into the local economy. The plans were launched by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, the youngest soldier ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest military decoration for valour. Launch: Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC helped to unveil the new retreat earlier this week and said it would offer something no doctor could . Lance Cpl Beharry, now 32, of the 1st . Battalion, Princess of Wales\u2019s Royal Regiment, was honoured for saving . members of his unit from ambushes on May 1 and June 11, 2004, in Al- . Amarah, Iraq. He suffered . serious head injuries after a rocket propelled grenade hit a vehicle six . inches from his, causing shrapnel injuries to his face and brain. Yet he managed to drag several comrades to safety. He said: 'For guys to be able to sit down and talk about the old days and what they have been through is something that doctors cannot offer. So we, as ex-servicemen and women, are going to cure ourselves. 'We are regimented and we are one family and we will look after each other. On civvy street you do not have that - this is a good way of continuing friendships.' Gary Russell, who suffered a serious leg injury in a landmine explosion in Bosnia, in 1995, said the village would be welcomed by military veterans. Ambitious scheme: Bill Liddle, who is leading the scheme, hopes it will be completed in five years . The father-of-three, from Consett, County Durham, who served with the Royal Fusiliers, said: 'People who are coming out of the service can find it difficult and may need counselling and medical treatment, such as physiotherapy, if they have been injured. 'When you are with someone who has been through what you have been through, you can talk about your experiences and that makes them easier to deal with. 'To have that sort of environment sitting there waiting for you when you come out, with a bungalow if you are in a wheelchair and with medical facilities on tap, is just a brilliant idea.' Veteran's Retreat hopes to raise initial funds of more than \u00a3100,000 to get the project up and running. The ambitious scheme is being led by former military policeman Bill Liddle, 64, who hopes the facility will be completed within five years. He said: 'We want to change the lives of hundreds of ex-service personnel who suffer physical or emotional trauma by providing a unique residential and medical facility, dedicated to the long-term care and support of former troops. 'It was fantastic to witness such over-whelming support, not only from the local community, but also from veterans themselves. This is the least we can do for guys who have given so much.' The Duke and Duchess of Northumberland are the charity's official patrons.",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- Iran has been carrying out covert tests of missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday, in contravention of a U.N. resolution. It has also said it wants to enrich uranium to \"levels far greater than is needed for peaceful nuclear energy,\" Hague said. Iran's development of missile and nuclear fuel technology has led to U.N. sanctions and accusations from the United States that the clerical regime is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it cannot verify whether Tehran's nuclear program remains entirely peaceful. Iran has not yet responded to Hague's claims. His comments in the House of Commons come a day after Iranian news agencies reported that the country's military had successfully test-fired 14 missiles during military drills, as part of a week of war games. Tehran also unveiled several ballistic missile silos Monday, and Wednesday demonstrated what was described by the semi-official Fars news agency as a new Iranian-made long-range radar system capable of monitoring low-altitude satellites. Speaking in London, Hague said: \"Iran has also been carrying out covert ballistic missile tests and rocket launches, including testing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload in contravention of U.N. resolution 1929, and it has announced that it intends to triple its capacity to produce 20% enriched uranium.\" The UK foreign secretary promised to \"maintain and continue to increase pressure on Iran to negotiate an agreement on their nuclear programme, building on the strengthening of sanctions,\" announced earlier this month. Enriched uranium can be used for civilian nuclear purposes, but also to make atomic weapons. The IAEA raised concerns in February that Iran was not engaging with the agency on claims that it was developing a nuclear payload for its missiles. The IAEA report discussed possible nuclear activities tied to Iran's military \"including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile.\" The United States imposed new sanctions on Iran last week, targeting the country's national airline, Iran Air, other companies, and international business executives accused of illicitly building up Tehran's military. Iran condemned those sanctions in a letter to the United Nations, saying the international body had a responsibility to look out for \"nations who are merely endeavoring to attain their legitimate and undeniable rights under international law.\" The United Nations passed a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June 2010, aimed at pressuring it to suspend its nuclear program.",

        "article": "People wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards are banned from riding public buses during the Xinjiang Sports Games in northwestern China, a Communist Party-run newspaper reports. The ban went into effect Monday in the city of Karamay, in the country's restive northwestern Xinjiang region. It applies to passengers who wear veils, large beards, as well as three types of Islamic dresses -- including those with the star and crescent symbol -- according to the Karamay Daily, a newspaper affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party. Dozens of public bus stations in the city will be manned by security personnel to conduct checks. The bus ban is being touted as one of a number of a security measures as the city hosts the 13th Xinjiang Sports Games, a large event in the autonomous region, the paper said, citing the event's organizing committee. The ban will be enforced through August 20, when the Games come to an end. Officials said those who violate the ban will be reported to the police, the paper reported. Uyghur rights groups have criticized the measure, calling it a \"green-light\" for racism. \"Officials in Karamay city are endorsing an openly racist and discriminatory policy aimed at ordinary Uyghur people,\" Uyghur American Association president, Alim Seytoff said in a statement. \"The concern is officials feel they can flaunt the laws of China in order to implement Xi Jinping's one year anti-terror campaign that appears more and more to be a wholesale onslaught against the Uyghur peoples' religious beliefs and practices. \"What this bus ban tells us is that Uyghurs in China have fewer rights than other citizens, even in their homeland, and that it green-lights discrimination against Uyghurs by ordinary Han Chinese.\" Dozens of public bus stations in the city will be manned by security personnel to conduct checks. The ban on bus riders wearing beards and Islamic-style clothing does not specifically single out Uyghurs, but its language clearly points to them as potential targets of the restrictions. It comes about a month after the Chinese authorities in the region banned students and civil servants from fasting during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. In recent years, the Xinjiang region has seen an uptick in violence between Uyghurs and Han Chinese over economic and other issues. Last week, nearly 100 people -- most of them \"terrorists,\" according to state media -- were killed in an attack in the region. A total of 37 civilians died, and police \"gunned down 59 terrorists,\" the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua reported, bringing the death toll to 96. There have been numerous attacks in the region, where tensions are simmering between Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic people, and Chinese Han people. A Muslim separatist group founded by militant Uyghurs has been blamed for terrorism in the area, the Council on Foreign Relations explains. Xinhua said the \"mastermind\" behind the attack last week \"had close connections with the terrorist organization,\" known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Karamay is a resource-rich city of some 450,000 people located in northwest Xinjiang, which has a dense Uyghur population.",

        "article": "By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:50 EST, 10 December 2013 . A hallucinogenic drug used in shamanic rituals in the Amazon is growing in popularity in the U.S., researchers have found. Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is the active ingredient in ayahuasca, which is a plant-based mixture that can also be smoked to give users a hallucinatory 'journey' more extreme than that of LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. Adam Winstock, founder of the Global Drugs Survey, claims it has 'a larger proportion of new users' compared to other powerful drugs. Ayahuasca: A shaman in the Coafan region boils leaves for their psychoactive properties as used in ayahuasca, Ecuador, 2009 . This suggests 'its popularity may increase,' Winstock says in the latest issue of the Journal of Psychopharmacology, according to the Huffington Post. The survey's findings are supported by results of another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the government, which found the number of people who have used DMT at some point has shot up from an estimated 688,000 in 2006 to 1.47 million in 2012. Smoked: The drug, pictured, which can be smoked is gaining popularity, particularly among young males . Male high school students were the most likely new users, Winstock found, and he says films are to blame for raising awareness about the drug. 'Mainstream interest since the release of the cult film \"Enter the Void\" in 2009 and the 2010 documentary \"DMT: The Spirit Molecule\", followed by a recent article in the influential youth magazine Vice featuring young people who had just smoked DMT will have raised awareness,' Winstock says. The Global Drug Survey is an anonymous study that provides a rare look into the illegal drugs being used at any point in time. Because the study isn't random, it doesn't show the prevalence of certain drugs but it can show, comparatively, which ones seem to be on the rise and how their users take them. According to the 2012 study, . conducted between November and December last year, DMT offers an . 'extreme hallucinatory experience' and users cite a 'bad trip' as a . potential risk. 'The . majority of users rated the effect of DMT as stronger than ketamine, . magic mushrooms and LSD,' the article explains, adding that they call it . a 'journey' rather than a trip to describe how the experience stands . apart, in kind and degree, to anything else. Ayahuasca brew is a combination of two plants that grow in South America. Journey: Users call a trip a 'journey' to describe how the experience stands apart, in kind and degree, to anything else . The first, Psychotria viridis, contains DMT which is listed as a Schedule I drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. By itself, though, DMT has no real effect and requires the second plant in the brew, Banisteriopsis caapi, to enable the brain to neutralize DMT.

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . An aspiring Oxbridge student who suffers from a rare condition that stops her coping with stress fears the pressure of cramming for exams could kill her. Jennifer Lloyd's illness means instead of producing adrenalin to cope when she gets anxious, the 17-year-old's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs. She has had to begin revising . for exams months in advance - in the hope she will banish any last minute cramming stress . that could trigger her disease. Rare illness: Jennifer Lloyd, from Prestwich, Manchester, fears cramming for tests more than all of her friends - because exam stress could kill her . Jennifer suffers from Addison's disease . which leaves her in danger of suffering a medical crisis at times of stress. If . she doesn't receive rapid treatment, she vomits, passes out or could . die. The teenager, who is studying for her AS-levels, suffered a major attack that left her in hospital last summer when she was preparing for her GCSEs. And she has even been forced to turn down interviews for Oxbridge schemes because she fears the stress of studying at the world-famous institutions away from home could be deadly. Jennifer, from Prestwich, Manchester, said: 'It's very tough when it gets to exam season as I have to balance my time perfectly. 'The illness leaves me very tired, so my mum often finds me asleep in my books while I've been studying. 'I know I can't let myself get unnecessarily stressed out, so I have to be much more organised than my friends. Addison's disease suffer Jennifer Lloyd studying hard in hospital for her upcoming exams . Talented student Jennifer Lloyd was diagnosed with Addison's disease as a child after her mother Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta . 'As a result I have a strict schedule where, if I do an hour of revision, I have to rest for two hours before doing any more. 'It means I can be short on time so I start preparing weeks in advance of everyone else to fit everything in. 'I . have been offered the chance to go and view Oxford and Cambridge . Universities as part of my college's Gifted and Talented students . programme, which is such an honour - but I just don't feel ready to move . away yet. The teenager with her mother Amanda: Instead of producing adrenalin to cope with stress, Jennifer's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs . Addison's affects around one in every 15,000 people and is caused by a lack of steroid hormones in the body. These are normally produced by the adrenal gland, but damage can cause levels to drop. The disease is normally caused by the body's own immune system turning on the adrenal gland, but cancer and tuberculosis can also trigger the condition. The impact on the body can be significant. One steroid, called cortisol, is involved in controlling how much water there is in the body as well as helping to fight inflammation. Another, aldosterone, regulates salt and water levels and blood pressure. Without properly-functioning adrenal glands the body cannot cope at times of stress - such as surgery, trauma or serious infection. The condition was discovered by Dr Thomas Addison in London in 1849. Jane Austen, John F Kennedy and Osama bin Laden are all thought to have been affected. Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, pathologists found 'almost no adrenal tissue' according to an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Now patients are treated with cheap steroid tablets. 'My college has . been incredibly supportive - my teachers know the danger signs and can . call my mum straight away if they think I'm getting ill. 'After . my first week at college, I wanted to quit because the stress of . meeting so many new people was making me ill, but my mentor, Beverley . Jones, convinced me to stay, which I'm really grateful for.' Jennifer . is gearing up for AS-level exams in psychology, geography, business and . photography, at Pendleton Sixth Form College, knowing she has to . prepare well in advance in case Addison's disease strikes. If she doesn't receive rapid treatment, the student suffers an Addisonian crisis where her eyes roll to the back of her head and she starts vomiting, requiring urgent hospital treatment. Now, after a decade, Jennifer is always prepared for when a 'crisis' hits, carrying a hydro-cortisone injection at all times - and she doubles her normal medication on the run up to important exams. She added: 'I want to be a child psychologist, but it's hard to study for exams because they're really stressful. 'I did most of my revision last year hooked up to a drip in hospital - my weight dropped to 5st10lb because my stomach stopped absorbing fats. 'I was thrilled when I managed to gain 10 A grades and two A*s though - all the stress paid off!' Jennifer was first diagnosed with Addison's 10 years ago after her mother, Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta. She said: 'The first time we noticed any of Jennifer's symptoms was when we were on holiday - she was eating salt straight from the shakers on restaurant tables. 'The rest of the family went a bit pink from the sun too, but Jennifer went very brown - she looked like she'd had a terrible spray tan. 'When we got home, we took her straight to the doctor's for tests, and we discovered she was craving salt because her body wasn't retaining it. 'She was diagnosed with Addison's weeks later, and in many ways it was a relief to finally know what was wrong, but the condition is hard for us all to live with.' In 2004 Amanda started a charity, called Jenny's Pennies, which has raised \u00a317,000 for the endocrine department at Manchester Children's Hospital in appreciation of Jennifer's care.",

        "article": "By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 08:06 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:29 EST, 12 November 2013 . The owner of a care home where elderly residents were dragged across the floor has dismissed a damning inspection report claiming it was based on a 'bad day'. Care inspectors found residents were left lying on filthy mattresses at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, while poor cleanliness also exposed them to the risk of infection. The Care Quality Commission report said poor staffing levels meant patients were at risk of being neglected while inspectors also found 'unpleasant odours', stains on patients' mattresses and filthy commodes which had not been cleaned properly. A damning report has revealed elderly residents at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, were dragged across the floor and left lying on filthy mattresses . But owner Sharanjit Purewal has defended the care home, saying: 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it. 'There are other homes in the area which have had much worse reports but they don't get taken out of proportion like this. 'The CQC has changed the goal posts slightly and that is something we are dealing with. 'We can't have changed overnight and our report in February was good, we have exactly the same staff.' Mr Purewal, who has owned the home since 2009, said: 'The staffing has improved since I have been here. 'The families like what we do and we move people on if we can't care for them.' CQC inspectors gave the care home a deadline of October 30 to improve its standards. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) demanded improvements at the home, which caters for 18 residents who mainly suffer from dementia . Inspectors have not yet revisited the home to check if the standards are being met but will publish a further report in due course when they have. The care home failed all six requirements and for five of these areas the CQC said action was needed. These included the residents consenting to any care and treatment given, the care and welfare of people at the home, the home's cleanliness and infection control, the home's staffing and how their records are kept. 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it' - Care home owner Sharanjit Purewal . But for assessing and monitoring the quality of service the CQC has taken enforcement action against the home - the most severe warning the watchdog can issue. On three occasions staff 'dragged' patients across the floor of the care home by their walking frames while ordering the residents to 'come on' if they were too slow. Another patient was also left lying on the floor after falling during the night. Poor records meant staff had no idea how long the person had been left stranded. The report said: 'We found the items listed were not clean and had sustained heavy soiling. 'For example, some of the commodes had stains to the pans and dried brown matter to the frames and under the seat of the chairs.' Inspectors also found dirty laundry stored in an open laundry basket with more heavily soiled items stored in the washing machine because 'staff told us they were only allowed to wash clothes at night'. The report added: 'We found that all of the mattresses we looked at were stained and had unpleasant odours.' The care home failed in all six of the inspection criteria . Staffing levels were deemed inadequate to deal with the needs of all 18 residents in the home and relief workers were not called in if staff failed to arrive for a shift - piling 'more pressure' on staff on duty. The report said: 'We noted from one person\u2019s care records that they had fallen during the night but staff were unable to determine the time this person had spent on the floor. 'For example, this person had been observed at 2.30am and found on the bedroom floor at 4am. 'We saw three instances where staff led people by dragging their frames. They encouraged people by saying: \"Come on X\" to hurry people along. 'This was because there were not enough staff to help people to the dining rooms.' The inspectors flagged the incident as 'unsafe' and received assurances it would be immediately addressed. The inspection also found care plans were not reviewed regularly and kept up-to-date and that monitoring and record-keeping of the service provided was inadequate. Many of the residents at Teme Court suffer from dementia-related illnesses and the CQC ordered owner Teme Care Limited to make improvements or face possible closure. The report concluded: 'We have taken enforcement action against Teme Care Limited to protect the health, safety and welfare of people using this service.' Worcestershire County Council and the county\u2019s three clinical commissioning groups have also been informed of the inspection. In a joint statement, they said: 'Worcestershire County Council is aware of the concerns that have been raised and is working with South Worcestershire CCG to support the home to improve the quality of care provision.'",

        "summary": "Photographs were collected by Sergeant Alex Statters in a scrapbook which is now going up for auction .",
        "article": "By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 12:33 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:02 EST, 14 March 2014 . An extraordinary collection of aerial photographs of World War One trenches has come to light nearly a century after the conflict. The images were collected by Sergeant Alex Statters, who served in France and helped to draw up maps of the battlefield on behalf of the Allied forces. They show how the trenches snaked across the countryside, which was pock-marked with hundreds of shell craters from the bombardment of the two sides. The photographs form part of a scrapbook compiled by Sgt Statters during the war, which also includes the telegram announcing the end of the conflict and a signed portrait of Winston Churchill. The book does not provide details of where and when the pictures were taken or of Sgt Statters service. He appears to have been a Royal Engineer (RE). Sapper were responsible for using balloons and aeroplanes to carry out reconnaissance missions above the trenches - the planes being flown by pilots from Army air units, and when it was formed, the Royal Air Force. The missions were fraught with danger and technical difficulty. As well as being targets for the Germans who would fire from the ground and attack from the air, taking pictures involved holding the camera firmly and hoping that the exposure was quick enough not to be shaken. Photographs had to have sufficient resolution to be of use to Royal Artillery gunnery crews on the ground, meaning that plate glass film was initially used. As technology advanced, lighter cameras were brought in, but compared to modern technology, they were still large, heavy and difficult to use. One of the documents on auction along with Sgt Statters' collection of pictures names a 'topo' - 'topography' unit, suggesting that he was part of one. These units were responsible for plotting where British batteries would be sited, and were part of the RE's Field Survey Companies, which produced reports which allowed Royal Artillery intelligence officers to plot both where to site their batteries, and where enemy guns were positioned. As the war progressed, more and more men were involved technology advanced, and the scale of the RE's operation expanded, so that by July 1918, the companies were upgraded to battalions. Artillery had become the deadliest killer in the trenches rapidly and dominated the war, meaning that assessing the impact of shells on the enemy, the accuracy of aim, and the location of enemy positions was crucial. It is unclear if Sgt Statters flew himself or acquired the pictures in the course of his work. The book is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch around \u00a32,500. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Aerial view: the location and timing of this view is unknown but it shows something of the scale of trench systems which were used by both the Allies and the Germans. There is very little evidence of shell damage, suggesting that these are newly entrenched areas - which could either by the start of the war, or more likely towards the very end when movement had resumed. They could also be training trenches, although their scale makes that unlikely. On the left of the picture, the trenches have a regular pattern but angular sections jutting out. This was intended to allow for sniper fire to protect against an incursion from no man's land. Across the top of the picture is a lengthy communications trench, which zig-zags to make sniper fire more difficult, and also to make it more difficult for artillery fire to rake it. It connects to other what are more likely to be front line trenches, which are in two rows running from top to bottom of the picture. The trenches are dug in a pattern lik . Damage: This photograph shows how the countryside was covered in shell craters from the aerial bombardment campaign carried out by both sides. The picture is one of the few which has information on it, dated 24 June 1917 top right corner. The date is shortly after the Battle of Messines had been launched. it is not known if this is in that area, but the scale of damage suggests a heavy bombardments.The remains of the roads which covered the area can still be seen. Close-up: It is hard to grasp the scale of trench warfare, but each section of the zig zag would have been between five and ten feet long. Zig zags were protective: if an enemy party managed to enter the trench, they could not fire down its length, and a soldier could defend the corner as long as ammunition - or more primitive weapons - held out. But the number of shell hols shows the constant danger soldiers were under. it also suggests the area is the very front line - the commucations trenches curve back from it towards the left of the photograph, but do not appear to project much further. Some short trenches extend beyond the apparent front line, which seems to run from top to bottom. They may be the remains of older workings. Intricate: This photograph is dated 18 March 1918. At the time both sides were experiencing something of a calm period - but only for a few more days. On 21 March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. Fortified in numbers thanks to Russia being out of the war, and using newly developed tactics of stormtroopers moving rapidly, they broke through the Allies positions, overran the trenches, and opened a war of movement. In the end, however, the Spring Offensive was seen by many historians as the Germans' undoing as the country did not have the resources to support the newly mobile armies, and their supply chains suffered. This photograph shows how trneches were built with forward-projecting sections like the tops of medieval battlements, and also built in rows. The presence of the corner at the top centre of the picture suggests some form of change of direction in the trenches, possibly due to change in the topography - the section here is built on flat ground. This picture is one of the few with specific geographical details. It appears to be taken in the air above German positions near Cambrai, in the Somme, and Arras, in the Nord Pas de Calais. At the top left is an arrow pointing towards the Bois de Bourlon, which is around three miles south-west of Arras. To the right is the village of Anneux, which is just outside Cambrai. In the front is the Hindeburg Line, a German defensive system which ran south from Arras. It was built in the winter of 1916 and 1917 and designed to hold off an expected offensive which the Germans believed would happen in the summer of 1917. The Hindenburg Line in fact largely held and although the Germans lost land in front of it (in this picture the fields in the foreground) it appeared to prevent a larger breakthrough by the Allies. The photograph is date 17 August 1917, by which time British offensives in the area had largely ended following the Second battle of Bullecourt. However there were further offensives after this photograph and in November 1917 Anneux was taken  by the 62nd (West Riding) Division on 20 and 21 November 1917. Anneux remained in Allied hands until the following 6 December. It was recaptured on 27 September 1918, by the 57th (West Lancashire) and 63rd (Royal Naval) Divisions, acting with the 52nd (Lowland) and the 1st and 4th Canadian Divisions. It is today home to a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, with the majority of soldier buried there from the Canadian army. This photograph has no geography or date, and shows both trenches and what appear to be heavy gun emplacements (top centre). The lack of shell damage and the small number of trenches suggests this is behind the front lines, where heavy guns would be emplaced. it is impossible to tell if it was a photograph taken to show German positions or British ones. The Royal Engineers photographed both to allow Royal Artillery intelligence officers to have a complete picture of the battlefield - meaning risky aerial missions with cumbersome cameras. Another undated image suggests positions behind the front lines, as the heaviest shell damage is concentrated at the bottom left. Lengthy communication trenches were needed to bring forward supplies, and although World War One was not a war of movement, the shifting positions of the fronts meant that not all were used all the time. Roads remained crucial - the white chalk road is typical of the north of France or Belgium, while the fields seem unused. It is unclear what the dark sections along the centre represent - it could be something printed on to the pictures to show planned fortifications, or the beginnings of works on the ground. The sheer scale of bombardment, together with the trenches on the right, suggests that this is a section which has recently been the subject of action. The trenches on the right are a front line, although the lack of clear information means whose - and where - is not known. The pictures are marked (top left) with coding which would allow the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery to assemble an overview of the battlefield. The pictures also show how roads - and in this case what may be the canal of the Somme, running from centre left to bottom right - survived bombardment, At the top of the photograph, however, the intense bombardment means the chalk underneath the topsoil is all that can be seen. Artillery units wanted to rain shells down on trenches, not elsewhere, but accuracy was limited. Shellfire became the main weapon of the war and each side became evenly matched in their ability to produce weapons and ammunition. Historic: Another object in the scrapbook is the telegram announcing the Armistice and the end of the First World War. The underlining of 'Topo' suggests that it was sent to the topographic section of a Royal Engineers Field Survey Battallion, which appears to be where Sgt Statters served. The signal was sent from the headquarters of the British Third Army, which in November 1918 was under the command of General Sir Julian (later Lord) Byng. Collector: The objects brought together by Sgt Statters are expected to fetch around \u00a32,500 when they go up for auction next week .",

The New York native was 57. A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of \"Rapper's Delight,\" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts. Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates \"Wonder Mike\" Wright and Guy \"Master Gee\" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including \"Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.\" Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday: . \"So sad to hear about our brother's passing.

Released in fall 1979, \"Rapper's Delight\" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit \"Good Times.\" \"Rapper's Delight\" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from \"Good Times,\" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song. \"It felt like a new art form,\" Rodgers said later of \"Rapper's Delight.\" In 2011, Rolling Stone ranked \"Rapper's Delight\" at No. 248 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

        "article": "For anyone who has experienced the brutality of a bully, a blunt-talking mayor in California with a horseshoe mustache now weighs in with this bit of wisdom: \"Grow a pair.\" Looking and talking like an Old West figure, Mayor Cameron Hamilton made his declaration while on the dais of the Porterville City Council last week. \"I'm against bullying, but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world,\" Hamilton said during the City Council meeting. \"(Most) people just have to grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves.\" Hamilton imparted his advice while discussing a proposal to create an anti-bullying safe zone for students. His remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and, in subsequent days, around the country. Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola immediately challenged the mayor. \"It's hard to just grow a pair when you're a 10-year-old girl,\" Gurrola shot back. The councilwoman's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor's tough-talking comments have roiled many people nationwide, especially advocates of bullying prevention. What's bullying . Indeed, in the past few years, a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and isn't -- bullying. Sponsors of National Bullying Prevention Month say it's wrong to view bullying as \"a childhood rite of passage\" and something to make \"kids tougher.\" In fact, bullying can be a traumatic experience, causing school avoidance, anxiety, depression and loss of self-esteem. Some researchers, however, say \"bullying\" has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights, teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships. The bald, cigar-smoking Hamilton seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy, but he wasn't backing down. He has also received some hate e-mail. \"Of course, I wish I would have put it a little different, a little less colorful, but let's not lose track of what the message is,\" Hamilton said in a CNN interview. Watch Hamilton speak about the controversy . \"We're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying,\" he continued. \"We're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from (something) or never allowed through the zero-tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves. \"The one I worry about the most is physical intimidation, and that's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence,\" he said. \"But if somebody puts their hands on you, it's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this.\" People should \"just tell the bully we're not going to put up with this,\" he said. Raising two grandchildren . Hamilton has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck. \"I guarantee I'm not raising them to be whiny,\" Hamilton said. But he's frustrated with school policies that don't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves, he said. His grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle. In fact, the principal called Hamilton about the incident. \"I asked my grandson afterwards, what'd you do about it?\" Hamilton said. \"I didn't do anything,\" the grandson told him, according to Hamilton. \"Why?\" Hamilton said. \"Because I'll get in trouble,\" the grandson told him. Hamilton expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero-tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem. Those zones empower bullies, Hamilton said. \"How do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable?\" Hamilton said. \"They don't expel them or don't suspend them. They have them come back to class, and you're brought back in the same environment.\" When Hamilton was in 7th grade, he was bullied by \"a guy that kept pullin' a knife on me,\" he said. \"I made up excuses not to go to school. ... I didn't tell my mom and dad what was going on, didn't tell my friends cause I didn't want them to think I was afraid of this guy,\" Hamilton said. \"Finally it came to a head. I dropped him like a rag doll. Everything was cool again,\" he said. Hate mail . Hamilton acknowledged he's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him. \"I could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind,\" he said. One e-mail was profane and condemning, but Hamilton read it aloud in a CNN interview. \"Hey there mayor... Just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth,\" the e-mail read, according to Hamilton. \"You have no idea what it's like to be bullied. You have no idea what it takes for a 10-year-old to stand up to someone who is picking on them. And you have no idea how much bad press you bring on Porterville. That town is a backwards bastion for bigotry, and you made it worse by becoming mayor.\" Among experts taking exception with Hamilton is Simone Bienne, a British human behaviorist and therapist who appears on U.S. television programs. \"I would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully,\" Bienne said. \"You can very easily say 'I'm against bullying,' but then blame the people, the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair. \"What does that actually mean? Be braver and you won't get bullied? I don't think that's how bullying works,\" Bienne said. \"If we put responsibility on children to do an adult's job, or to do a politician's job or to do a teacher's job, then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children! -- to be adults.\"",

        "summary": "Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, ran over two Canadian soldiers, killing one .\nInvestigators say he had become radicalized by Islam and was feared to be en route to become a jihadi .\nWarrant Officer Patrice Vincent succumbed to his injuries .",
        "article": "A young convert to Islam who killed a Canadian soldier in a hit-and-run had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey, authorities said Tuesday. Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney said the attack Monday was 'clearly linked to terrorist ideology.' Quebec Police spokesman Guy Lapointe said the act was deliberate and that one of the two soldiers was in uniform. Police said the suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, called 911 to report his hit-and-run as police chased him in the Quebec city of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu. He later was shot dead by police after his car flipped over into a ditch and he brandished a knife as he exited his car. A second soldier suffered minor injuries in the attack. Scroll down for video . The suspect's car is overturned in the ditch in a cordoned off area in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, where one of two soldiers hit by a car  died of his injuries early Tuesday . Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was killed by a young convert to Islam in a hit-and-run in Quebec . Couture-Rouleau, 25, was one of 90 people in the country suspected of intending to join fights abroad or who have returned from overseas, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson. He first came to attention of authorities in June because of Facebook postings that showed he had become radicalized and wanted to leave the country to fight, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Martine Fontaine. Police seized his passport at the airport in July when he tried to travel to Turkey, Fontaine said. He was arrested and questioned but there wasn't enough evidence to charge him with a crime, she said. Fontaine said police subsequently met with him several times, including as recently as Oct. 9, when she said he indicated that wanted to take steps to change. They also met his parents and the imam of his mosque and tried to exert a positive influence over him. 'Many interventions with him were carried out to try and avoid the tragic events,' Fontaine said. 'It's very difficult when someone is planning an act alone and there is no obvious preparation involved and used a vehicle as a weapon.' A knife stuck in the ground is located near an overturned car involved in a police chase in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu on Monday. The driver died, 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau, had become influenced by radical Islam . Fontaine said they couldn't arrest him for having radical thoughts. It was not known whether Couture-Rouleau had any ties to Islamic militant groups. 'He was part of our investigative efforts to try and identify those people who might commit a criminal act travelling abroad for terrorist purposes,' Paulson said. Canada raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday due to 'an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations like ISIL, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and others who pose a clear threat to Canadians,' said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister. 'This increase is not the result of a specific threat,' de Le Rue said. Nobody answered the door at Couture-Rouleau's single story white brick home in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he lives with his father. Neighbor Daniel Fortin said he had known Couture-Rouleau since he was a child. Fortin said over the past year or so, he grew out his beard and began wearing loose-fitting Muslim clothing but that he never felt threatened by him. Fortin said Couture-Roleau's father was worried as he became increasingly radicalized and 'tried everything,' to help him. A Quebec business data base shows he started a water-pressure cleaning company in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu in 2012 with two other people. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the slain soldier, 53-year-old Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, was a 28-year veteran with 'distinguished service.' 'This was a despicable act of violence that strikes against not just this soldier and his colleagues but frankly against our very values as a civilized democracy,' Harper said in Parliament. Martin Couture Rouleau's car is pictured after he was shot and killed by police . Police investigators take photos at the scene where two soldiers were struck by the suspect . Lapointe said the suspect sat in his car in the parking lot outside a veterans' support center for at least two hours before the hit and run. He said the other soldier is in stable condition with minor injuries. The case is similar to one in London last year in which an al-Qaida-inspired extremist and another man ran over a soldier with a car before hacking the off-duty soldier to death. Images of Michael Adebolajo, 29, holding a butcher knife and cleaver with bloodied hands in the moments after the May 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby shocked people around the world and sparked fears of Islamist terrorism in Britain. The Islamic State group has urged supporters to carry out attacks against Western countries, including Canada, that are participating in the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants who have taken over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. Eight Canadian fighter jets, including two spares, are set to depart for the region Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf condemned the attack and said they have been in touch with Canadian officials. 'We deplore acts of violence toward military and law enforcement, and stand ready to assist our Canadian partners as they investigate this act,' Harf said.

        "article": "(CNN) -- A 2-year-old who went missing from his home in Dewey, Arizona, on Monday night was found dead Wednesday, according to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. The body of Emmett Trapp was found by search and rescue personnel at 11:30 a.m. about one mile from his home, lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site. \"We are just devastated by the loss of this little boy,\" sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. The area where his body was found on the former Iron King Mine site is being treated as a crime scene, which the sheriff's office described as \"common protocol.\" The cause of death appears to be a result of spending more than 24 hours exposed to Arizona's elements, Sgt. Jeff Newnum said. An autopsy was scheduled to be performed later Wednesday, he said. He added that there was \"no foul play at Emmett's body that would suggest something was awry.\" Emmett was the second 2-year-old boy to go missing from Yavapai County in 10 days. His case is believed to be unrelated to the disappearance of Sylar Newton -- another 2-year-old who went missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock and is presumed dead, D'Evelyn said Tuesday. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The mother told authorities that she and her four children were at their home in the Dewey-Humboldt area, about 80 miles north of Phoenix. When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening, Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top, diaper and no shoes -- was missing. The family dog had also apparently wandered off with Emmett, but returned when called. The mother told police she searched around the home and immediate area without success. Newnum said the door to the house was unlocked at the time of Emmett's disappearance, and it appears the boy walked as many four miles, crossing hilly, rough terrain, before he was found. Newnum credited the muddy terrain in the area with helping find Emmett. He said the small footprints around the site indicate the boy \"was by himself.\"",

        "article": "With Russia's economy shrinking for the first time in five years amid an onslaught of Western sanctions, you would expect its citizens to be holding back on needless expenditure. But, as these Instagram images show, some Russians have been splashing their roubles on caviar, posting pictures of the delicacy online. Despite the country's financial woes, many have uploaded the photographs with the hashtag '#\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0438' - which translates as '#whatcrisis'.

While red caviar, made from salmon roe, is associated with luxury and wealth, it is less costly in Russia because of the vast harvest of the fish off the country's eastern coast. Despite this, after today's announcement that the country's gross domestic product had fallen for the first time since 2009, many Russians would be expected to be striking caviar off their shopping lists. Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have started to move their money abroad. Russia's gross domestic product had fallen for the first time since 2009, but that did not stop some citizens from enjoying caviar . Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, but not this Instagram user . Plummeting: How the value of the rouble has fallen against the pound in the last year . Many Russian companies and banks have been locked out of Western capital markets following the sanctions imposed on the country for its involvement in annexing Crimea. Inflation is also growing rapidly. Amid the rouble's collapse earlier this month, Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent to prop up the currency. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned last week that the economy could shrink 4 per cent next year based on oil prices of around $60 a barrel - their lowest level for many years. In a response to the emerging crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin last week placed a cap on the price of vodka in an attempt to boost morale and stop citizens from making their own bootleg booze. According to a study by leading international universities last year, a quarter of all Russian men die before they reach their mid-fifties, and their love of alcohol - particularly vodka - is partly to blame.",

Warning: Ukraine's Yatsenyuk, right, says that President Putin wants his country to remain under Russian influence . The tough new measures against Russia will be unveiled as Ukraine today accused pro-Moscow rebels of waging fresh attacks in eastern Ukraine despite a ceasefire imposed on Friday. The sanctions are expected to prevent them raising funds for periods longer than 30 days, effectively shutting them off from EU capital markets. Action is also expected against two dozen senior Russian names including those in Mr Putin's circle. Tough new sanctions against Russia have been unveiled by the EU, with some set to target associates of President Vladimir Putin (left) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (right) Rosneft, an oil monolith, is run by Mr Putin's close associate Igor Sechin.\u00a0Gazpromneft is an oil-production and refining subsidiary of OAO Gazprom, while Transeft is involved in oil transportation.

Formal approval of the measures was expected later on Monday. They are expected to come into effect on Tuesday.

The president added that Ukraine had secured the release of 1,200 \u00a0'prisoners' who had been\u00a0taken captive by pro-Russian rebels during their five-month separatist uprising. Mr Poroshenko's trip to the strategic port, just days after it faced sustained rebel fire, underscored that Kiev is unlikely to willingly loosen what remains of its grip on Ukraine's rebellious east. It also came as a tenuous cease-fire appeared to be holding Monday between the Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine. A defence spokesman earlier said that Ukrainian positions were still coming under sporadic attack despite the ceasefire.

Russian and U.S. officials will meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss a nuclear arms treaty whose future is in doubt. Washington and Moscow have questioned each other's commitment to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and their relationship has deteriorated over the Ukraine crisis. Interfax new agency quoted Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's non-proliferation and arms control department, as saying talks  would take place this week involving Rose Gottemoeller, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. The INF treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 300-3,400 miles near the end of the Cold War. The U.S. says Russia has violated the treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile that is banned under the accord. Meanwhile Russia has questioned Washington's observation of the treaty, saying U.S. use of armed drones amounted to a violation of its terms. He also alleged that Russia had massed military hardware at Sloviyanoserbsk in Lugansk region. After representatives of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) left a roadblock of the Ukrainian National Guard there, it was surrounded by four T-72 Russian tanks, two airborne combat vehicles, two armoured infantry vehicles, four mechanized infantry combat vehicles and about 70 soldiers. EU President Herman Van Rompuy said the new sanctions due to be approved on Monday could be reviewed if the ceasefire was 'durable'. 'We have noted that Russia only consented with difficulty to serious negotiations. The ceasefire is an important step, but it is only a step,' he said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has vowed to respond to any new sanctions, hinting that Western air companies would be barred from using Siberian airspace for flights between Europe and Asia. If the Russian energy and financial industries are hit, then 'we will have to respond asymmetrically - for example, with restrictions in the transport sphere.' If European airlines are forced to fly around Russian airspace - for example on routes to and from Asia on which they overfly Siberia - it could threaten their viability, he said. 'It may lead to bankruptcy of many airlines that are teetering on the brink of survival,' he said. 'We would just like our partners to realise that', he said. And in a further development, there were new fears for the Ukraine ceasefire today as premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Vladimir Putin of sucking his country's blood while warning Kiev would impose martial law. Fragile ceasefire: Ukrainian soldiers guard a checkpoint as the tense truce entered its third day . The premier alleged Mr Putin's plan remained unchanged - to dismember Ukraine as a country - despite a truce which is already under strain three days after it was signed. He said that\u00a0If the ceasefire breaks, Ukraine would impose martial law despite Western objections. 'This means that the entire country will be running on entirely military lines, starting from civil defence and ending with the military command having full power on Ukrainian territory,' he said in an interview on Kiev's One Plus One TV. People take advantage of a break in fighting to queue for food outside a Red Cross building in Mariupol . 'This is war. We have one now. It has not been legally declared. But it's war.' He forecast the West would object because martial law would close off talks on a peace plan and resolving the crisis by non-military methods, but he questioned Mr Putin's sincerity over Ukraine. 'Do I believe the Russian Federation and its president? Categorically, no,' he said. 'Has President Putin changed his plans? Under no circumstances. 'His plan is to return Ukraine to the Russian sphere of influence by any means - by conquering it militarily or politically, or by destroying the state as such.' The port city of Mariupol, above, has been hit by shelling in recent days despite the ongoing ceasefire . President Putin's aim was to turn eastern Ukraine into 'unrecognised republics' like Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia or Transnistria in Moldova, where Russia holds sway, and grave damage has been done already to Lugansk and Donetsk, he said. 'He wants to control and via his mercenaries suck Ukraine's blood,' he said. 'All the infrastructure is destroyed. We've reached the point where we have problems with coal, because they targeted mines with their rockets and tanks. They have blown up railways. They destroyed the energy sector as such.' Stating that Ukraine would end its dependence on Russian gas in five years as it turns towards the West, he said there could be no return to 'business as usual' with Moscow. 'The world does not have the right to forget about Russian aggression. Russia must pay the price. Yes, we are for making peace. But we are also for ensuring that those who breached the peace, who violated the UN charter, violated all possible and impossible bilateral and multilateral agreements, pay the price. And that is the Russian Federation.' He claimed the ceasefire was necessary now 'in order to save lives', allow troops to regroup. But he appeared to doubt that the conditions exist for a lasting truce, amid fighting in three cities since it came into operation. He added that the conditions were that 'the shooting stops. Second, Mr Putin withdraws his mercenaries, his army and his hardware. Third, Ukraine fully restores control over the state border.'",

        "article": "(CNN)  -- An early-morning hazardous material spill has been contained, but officials in Morehead City, North Carolina have closed its port and recommended evacuation of its downtown area after nine containers of high-explosive materials were punctured. The incident occurred when a forklift unloading a vessel punctured a large container and the drums inside it that contained the explosive compound PETN, said Morehead City Police spokeswoman Amy Thompson. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to set off an explosion aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. PETN is a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin.

And if they choose to stay home, stay away from windows and doors,\" Mayor Jerry Jones told CNN. \"Don't get out and sightsee and meander around. It is dangerous, and we need to ensure the safety of our public. As the day goes on and we feel like we have more information, we will pass that information on.\" He said that emergency management officials \"feel that everything is contained.\" But at the early stages in the cleanup, they advised keeping people from getting closed to the port. Carteret County officials said U.S. 70 will be closed from 4th Street in Morehead City to the Morehead-Beaufort high-rise bridge for most of the day. The Coast Guard has barred traffic to and from the zone. The Coast Guard captain of the port ordered the facility closed and a 300-yard safety zone has been established to exclude any vessels operating any closer. Jones said the port called the city before 4:45 a.m. ET to say that a product spilled out of drums on the port property. \"We immediately identified it was a hazardous material, assessed that it was contained on the port and not (going) to go into our neighboring waters, into the waterway,\" he said. Police, fire and explosive ordnance crews from nearby Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point arrived at the scene, and an incident command center was set up nearby. Jones confirmed that the material in the containers is PETN, allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to bomb Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam on December 25. PETN is a high explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Jones said PETN is a crystal packaged in water for stability. He said the people who transport \"any highly flammable explosive devices\" have to and did notify the port and local emergency and police officials. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Chris O'Neil said the substance has industrial and medical uses. \"Being an international port, we handle highly flammable explosive material all the time. Jet fuel comes through here all the time, gasoline, propane. So it's not unusual to have explosive material coming through Morehead City,\" he said. Also responding were the U.S. Customs and the Salvation Army.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The first American to orbit the Earth has undergone successful heart surgery. Former Sen. John Glenn, 92, had a heart valve replaced last month at the Cleveland Clinic, according to Hank Wilson, director of communications for the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. \"He's in great shape,\" and is at home in Columbus, Ohio, recovering, Wilson said. Glenn, piloting the Mercury space capsule dubbed Friendship 7, became the first American to orbit Earth on February 20, 1962, circling the planet three times in just under five hours. He is the last surviving of the original seven U.S. astronauts from Project Mercury. In 1998, at age 77, he flew a nine-day mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person to travel in space. Glenn, a Democrat, served as a U.S. senator from 1974 until 1999, and ran for president in 1984.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill should be sick of each other by now. And if they weren't really friends off screen, they probably would be. After filming the surprisingly successful \"21 Jump Street\" and reteaming for the June 13 follow-up, \"22 Jump Street,\" the two actors have put in countless hours filming and doing press for their projects, the kind of time that could strain any professional relationship. But as Tatum told CNN at the \"22 Jump Street\" premiere on Tuesday, these two got \"lucky.\" \"It doesn't always work out like this,\" Tatum, 34, said. \"Sometimes you take a movie because you like someone's work, and then you get to work with them and you don't actually enjoy working with them. And we just got really lucky.\" In the \"Jump Street\" movies, the pair play former high school foes who become friends after being partnered as police officers. The concept is a spin on the '80s TV series of the same name, and, like in the TV show, Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko are at first sent to work undercover in a high school. The resulting comedy, \"21 Jump Street,\" was released in March 2012 to critical praise and box office success, proving that Tatum could do more than just sub as a heartthrob. \"21 Jump Street\" was such a hit that it wasn't long before a sequel was announced, and by most accounts, \"22 Jump Street\" is just as funny as the first. What works so well in the film, which sees the pair's undercover cops head to work on a college campus, is what cements the duo's bond off-screen: a raunchy, daring sense of humor. For example, the \"X-rated\" bet that they made before the opening of \"21 Jump Street\" -- wherein Hill promised to \"kiss the tip\" of a certain part of Tatum's anatomy through his underwear if they reached $35 million that first weekend -- is exactly the kind of off-the-wall camaraderie that comes across on screen. \"For this kind of movie,\" Hill observed at the premiere, \"the friendship translates into what the movie's about, which is kind of rad.\" CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne believe's he has 'definitely' got the quality to play for England. The 23-year-old has been ever-present in Saints' charge to second place in the Barclays Premier League, making the right back shirt his own following Calum Chambers' move to Arsenal. He was rewarded with a first international call-up for last month's Euro 2016 double header against San Marino and Estonia but was an unused substitute in both games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's  Big Match Stats: Hull  vs Southampton . Nathaniel Clyne beats Mohamed Diame for pace before whipping in a cross against Hull on Saturday . 'It's always good to play for your country. If you play well then you get picked up,' he said. 'I think I've got the ability to play for my country, definitely. I'm playing with lots of confidence. 'Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap.' Southampton needed a mis-hit clearance from Hull's third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic and wonderful 40-yard strike from Victor Wanyama to see off Hull on Saturday, but their winning habit is becoming unshakeable. When previous boss Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham in the summer and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren followed him out of the door, a season of struggle was widely predicted. England manager Roy Hodgson was in attendance to see Southampton duo Fraser Forster and Clyne . Yet they have now won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, with the meanest defence in the top flight and only Chelsea above them. Unsurprisingly, spirits are high. 'We keep winning and getting clean sheets, hopefully we can keep up our run of form and see where we go with it,' said Clyne. 'A few of the lads are talking about the Europa League, Europe and stuff. But we've just got to keep pushing and hopefully the results will take care of themselves.' Hull, meanwhile, were unable to build on battling draws at Arsenal and Liverpool in their previous two matches. The young full-back has been one of Southampton's most impressive performers this season . Despite the slender scoreline, Southampton were clearly the better side and could have added as many as three to their tally with better finishing. Nevertheless, they would be forgiven for wondering what might have been had Jakupovic, starting in the Premier League for only the third time with Allan McGregor and Steve Harper injured, not erred. He sent the ball straight to Wanyama when attempting to clear, leaving himself badly out of position as the ball sailed back into his net. But midfielder Stephen Quinn insists the Swiss must put the incident behind him as soon as possible. Clyne was called up to train with the national squad but didn't make an actual appearance . 'It's been difficult for Eldin, he's been a long time out as second or third choice keeper and he came in and did ever so well at Liverpool last week,' said Quinn. 'He's a good keeper, but he made a simple mistake and a lot of the time you can get away with those. 'I'm sure he will be dejected but he's got to be a man about it and get his head up because it looks like he'll be starting again next week. 'You can't dwell on it. He has to look to the next game and try to improve.'",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:05 EST, 1 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:54 EST, 2 December 2013 . Producers of an upcoming film starring actor Paul Walker, who died tragically in a fiery California car crash Saturday, say they\u2019re sticking to the planned release date of December 13. The drama focused on Hurricane Katrina is called Hours and sees Walker taken a decidedly more serious turn that producers say makes it all the more important for the film to go forward. \u2018After lots of back and forth, this is our decision. It's Paul's tour de force. He's in every frame of the movie,\u2019 said Paul Presburger, CEO of Pantelion Films. Scroll down for video... Show will go on: Here, the late actor Paul Walker is seen in a still from his upcoming film Hours, about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. Producers have announced they'll proceed with the planned December 13 release of the film despite its star's death Saturday in a fiery car crash . The Hollywood Reporter points out that the film\u2019s subject matter may have been one of great personal interest to Walker. The 40-year-old father of one had a charity he founded in 2010 in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. And his own tragedy came during a Santa Clarita, California charity function on Saturday for those affected by the recent typhoon in the Philippines. \u2018Hours embodies a message that was so important to him, which is that you have to do everything you can to keep friends and family safe,\u2019 producer Peter Safran told the Hollywood Reporter. The film also stars Genesis Rodriguez as the wife of Walker's character. Their child is born tragically sick during the chaos of Hurricane Katrina . 'He was looking for something to showcase his acting skills': Producers said the film was a passion project for Walker and that he would have wanted it released . 'Important to him': Producer Peter Safran said the subject matter was Walker's personal passion. The actor died Saturday during a charity event for victims of the recent typhoon in the Philippines . Walker was killed when the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT he was in with his friend and former race car driver Roger Rodas, 38, went out of control and smashed into a tree. Images from the resulting fire and its aftermath appeared unsurvivable. Police said speed was likely a factor in the crash. Now, audiences in 15 select U.S. cities and video on demand viewers will be able to see the film producers say was the late actor\u2019s passion project starting December 13. Co-starring Genesis Rodriguez, the film follows Walker after hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005. Walker and Rodriguez play a couple about to become parents whose lives take a tragic turn when their baby is born with an illness during the chaos that came with Katrina. \u2018He was looking for something to showcase his acting skills, which he so rarely had the chance to do. He hit it out of the park,\u2019 Safran told THR. Safran believes the release is what the film\u2019s star would have wanted. Tragic: Walker was 40 years old when the car he was in left the road Saturday and exploded in flames in Santa Clarita on Saturday afternoon . \u2018Paul would have very much wanted us to move forward. He was incredibly proud of this project. We did a press junket two weeks ago, and I remember sitting with him and how excited he was for people to see this movie. He really looked to this movie to show people that he is an actor,\u2019 the producer said. Walker died just before he was set to shoot key scenes for Fast & Furious 7 in Atlanta. Producers of that film must now decide how to move forward. Fast & Furious 7 was set to be released in July of 2014 and remained unfinished, so Universal must either change the plot of the upcoming film in a way that addresses Walker\u2019s death or scrap the film altogether.",

        "article": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Up, up and away. Way away -- to the moon, in fact. China launched an experimental spacecraft early Friday that is scheduled to orbit the moon before returning to Earth, a first for the country's ambitious space program and considered a precursor to a planned mission to the moon. The unmanned spacecraft was launched by a Long March 3C rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan, western China, state media said. It is China's first lunar module capable of returning to Earth and the mission's main technical challenge will be making sure the spacecraft slows down enough to re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. Too fast and it could overheat or become difficult to track and control, Hu Hao, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, told The China Daily. It is expected to take around a week to fly around the moon. The spacecraft will end its mission by landing on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The mission tests technology that will be used in a more ambitious launch, scheduled to take place in 2017, when an unmanned lunar probe will go to the moon, collect soil samples and return home. Chinese astronauts have made five manned space flights on a series of Shenzhou \"Divine Vessel\" modules, with the latest mission in 2013 completing a successful manual docking with the Tiangong-1 space station. Last December, China put a lunar rover -- known as the Jade Rabbit -- on the moon but it has been plagued by mechanical troubles, the China Daily said. On course for the moon? Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said the lunar orbiter marks a step forward in the capabilities needed for a potential manned lunar program, which while under discussion hasn't been officially approved yet. \"It's significance is not only in demonstration of technical abilities, but in a continued political will to achieve its space goals over long periods of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which is what China has that the U.S. currently lacks.\" While the United States has pulled back its space program, other countries are trying to match or surpass China's accomplishments in what some observers have called an Asian space race. In September, India became the first Asian country to send an orbiter around Mars. Political symbolism . China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has made rapid advances in the intervening decade. Despite this, its space program is still yet to achieve capabilities reached by the U.S. and then Soviet Union decades ago, says James A. Lewis, director and senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. With little economic or military advantage, its value, he says, lies in how the space program shapes China's perception of itself -- a conspicuous display of national power and wealth that asserts China's return to confidence and authority. \"We could ask if China is following an outdated recipe for superpower status,\" he writes in a blog for the University of Nottingham in the UK. \"In terms of the global effect of the manned program, there might be some truth to this. But for the domestic audience that is the chief concern of China's leaders, the space program produces invaluable results.\"",

Rescue crews were scouring the north of San Francisco Bay for a missing pilot after two small vintage planes collided while heading home from a show, sending one crashing into the water while the other miraculously managed to land. Debris was found in San Pablo Bay after the 4.05pm collision near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, but the pilot has still not been found, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Loumania Stewart. The mid-air crash involved a single engine 1965 Cessna 210 and a World War Two era Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20, piloted by a husband and wife crew, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. Scary: Two small planes collided over San Pablo Bay near San Francisco on Sunday . The Cessna crashed into the water and the Sea Fury's pilot was able to land 40 minutes later at Eagle's Nest Airport in the small Northern California city of Ione, Gregor said. Amador County firefighters and medics sent to the Ione airport were not needed because the pilot and passenger in the Sea Fury - a husband and wife - were not injured, the county's Undersheriff Jim Wegner said. Both planes had departed from Eagle's Nest Airport to participate in the Pacific Coast Dream Machines, an annual festival in Half Moon Bay that features a variety of planes, motorcycles, and cars. Both planes left Half Moon Bay Airport, about 20 miles south of San Francisco, and were on their return flight to Ione. Miracle: One of the planes was able to land safely at an air field a few miles away from the bay . Witnesses at Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Cessna spiraled out of control and crashed into the choppy water after the collision. 'Everyone associated with the Pacific Coast Dream Machines Show is terribly saddened by this news and we hope and pray the missing plane and survivors are found,' the event organizers said in a statement. Four Coast Guard boats and a helicopter searched the choppy bay waters, along with five boats from local law enforcement agencies, including the Marin County Sheriff's Office and the Sausalito Police Department, as well as a local helicopter. 'It clipped a wing, probably lost a wing, spun violently and hit the water,' said witness Eric Johnson to KTVU. 'Tragic. The plane spinning that hard, you can't jump out, you can't get away. It's really sad.' Divers from the San Francisco Police Department also were on the scene. Wegner wouldn't discuss damage to the Sea Fury, citing the ongoing investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board. The names of the pilots involved have not been released as of Monday morning. Search: Rescuers are now searching the San Pablo Bay near San Francisco for the second plane involved in the collision . Classic aircraft: This is a Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20 - a British fighter jet used in the Second World War and the Korean War - a model like this was involved in a mid-air collision over San Francisco Bay on Sunday . The British Hawker aircraft, named Dreadnought, was one of the featured aircraft at the Pacific Coast Dream Machines event in Half Moon Bay on Sunday - which annually showcases a variety of planes, motorcycles, vintage cars and other customized vehicles. The Hawker is famed for its racing pedigree and is registered to Sanders Aircraft Ince, which restores classic airplanes and is operated by brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders. The plane was rebuilt by their father, Frank Sanders, who died in a 1989 plane crash. Sanders Aeronautics' website said the family-run company specializes in aircraft restoration and brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders are avid air racers.",

Arnold Schwarzenegger. Those guests and others capped his 25-year run behind the microphone with CNN. \"Welcome to the last 'Larry King Live.' It's hard to say that,\" King said in his opening remarks to his last show. He was joined on the set by comedian Bill Maher and television host Ryan Seacrest. On several occasions, King stifled tears, especially when Maher put King in the same company as TV legends Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Walter Cronkite. \"This is not Larry's funeral,\" Maher interjected early in the show. \"Larry is hopefully going to be in our living rooms for years to come. This is the end of a show, not the end of a man.\" King wore his signature suspenders -- a pair of red ones with a red-and-white polka-dot tie over a black shirt. At end of his hourlong broadcast, King became choked up with his final sentences. \"It's not very often in my life that I've been without words,\" King said. He thanked his staff and producers. \"When I started 25 years ago in a little studio in Washington, D.C., I never thought it would last this long or come to this,\" King said. \"I'm going to do specials on CNN and do radio work ... so you're not going to see me go away, but you're not going to see me on this set any more. \"I don't know what to say, except to you my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long?\" King concluded. His set then went black -- except for a spotlight illuminating his chrome microphone. In his overall 53 years in broadcasting, King amassed 50,000 interviews, 6,120 shows in CNN's archives, 10 Cable ACE Awards, an Emmy, a Peabody and an entry in the Guinness World Records for having the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot. Among the guests on the last show was Schwarzenegger, who appeared by a satellite transmission from the capital of Sacramento. The governor extended congratulations and displayed the written proclamation declaring Thursday as belonging to King. \"Thank you,\" King said, adding this quip: \"and keep this in mind: I'll be back.\" King will be working on special projects for CNN. In a pre-recorded videotaped message, President Obama called King \"one of the giants in broadcasting.\" \"You say all that you do is ask questions, but for generations of Americans, the answers to those questions have surprised us and they have informed us,\" Obama said. From a studio in New York, talk show host Regis Philbin tried to engage King in a song, but King was caught off guard. \"I lost the $500 question,\" King joked. Joining Philbin in New York was Donald Trump. \"You shouldn't be leaving anything, Larry,\" Trump said. \"Nobody ever did it better.\" Also in New York was comic Fred Armisen, who dressed up exactly like King and then started interviewing him. \"Now Larry,\" Armisen said, \"what has been my favorite interview?\" King: \"You know you've done so many, it's hard to pick one out.\" Armisen: \"Larry, what is the most interesting thing about me.\" King: \"The most interesting about you is you're a little whacko.\" Armisen: \"What question have you asked more than any?\" King: \"Why. You see the best question of all, Lar, is why. Because it can't be answered in one word and it forces the person to think.\" Armisen: \"Besides holding up my pants, why do I wear suspenders?\" King: \"I will not stop wearing them. No matter what I do in life, the suspenders will remain.\" News anchors Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, and Brian Williams joined talk show host Barbara Walters in extending farewells. They were also telecasted from a set in New York. \"We are your prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, your groupies,\" Sawyer said, giving King a pair of suspenders embroidered with the four guests' and King's names. \"All of us have done heads of state\" interviews, Walters said. \"No one has done more than you.\" After King moved the conversation to Williams, Williams remarked: \"You've just done what scores of network executives have been unable to do. You just snatched airtime from Barbara Walters.\" Couric read from a poem she wrote for King, in which one verse went: . \"You made NAFTA exciting and that's hard to do. \"And you scored the Paris Hilton post-jail interview,\" Couric recited. Former president Bill Clinton, who just returned from a visit to Haiti and was in Little Rock, Arkansas, said he admired King's work ethic. Clinton had appeared 28 times on King's show. \"I'm like you,\" Clinton said in a live feed from Arkansas. \"I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but it keeps me out of the grave.\" Seacrest read from a letter written to King from the Rev. Billy Graham, who wrote: \"You will be greatly missed in my evening routine.\" Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw joined the Hollywood set toward the end of the show and asked King how he felt. King turned the question on McGraw: \"How am I doing?\" \"With grace,\" McGraw said. \"You never like to be the center of attention,\" McGraw later said. \"You ask short questions.\" Turning to Seacrest and Maher, he added: \"He told me years ago, if it's more than 2 sentences, it's too long.\" King was then joined by his wife, Shawn, and two sons, Chance, 11, and Cannon, 10, to hear Tony Bennett sing \"Best is Yet to Come\" from Lake Charles, Louisiana. \"How about them apples,\" King said afterwards. \"Thanks for all the great interviews you've given us, Larry,\" Bennett said. Chance said he looked forward to seeing more of his father. Cannon then stole the show momentarily with an uncanny impersonation of his father, as if he were talking to him and then his mother: . \"Get in the car. I'm too old for this. I've done this for 50 years,\" Cannon said, with an entertaining imitation of King's gravelly voice. \"Stop doing your makeup. This is the last show. We're going to be late.\" When King ended his last show and the airtime moved on to Anderson Cooper for his show, the anchor summarized: \"a remarkable moment and a remarkable man.\"",

        "summary": "Survey finds 24% of respondents skip medical care when they're sick or injured .\nLargest groups affected by high prices: uninsured and people between 28 and 44 .\nDeloitte Survey also finds people shopping around for best prices .\nOther trends: walk-in clinics in drug stores and medical tourism in cheaper nations .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- Americans are forgoing medical attention in the face of high health-care costs, a new consumer health survey has found. The high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment, a survey finds. Specifically, 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured. The largest subgroups were those who were uninsured (36 percent), and those between ages 28 and 44, referred to as \"Gen Y\" respondents in the survey (37 percent). Two-fifths of the people who didn't see a doctor when they needed one did so because of the high cost of care. They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center. \"Costs are impacting the system, and it's changing how we respond to our health care,\" said Paul Keckley, executive director of the center. In addition to data about how many Americans fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs, another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers' dissatisfaction with the nation's health-care system: . \u2022 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security. \u2022 More than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by Americans on health care is a waste. \u2022 Only 6 percent indicated their own family is totally prepared to shoulder the financial burden they expect to face. Not only are Americans putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction, they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors' fees, prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs, according to the survey. There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them. \"This study suggests that people really don't [stay],\" Keckley added. \"And that's surprising.\" Despite the desire to shop around and gather more information to make improved decisions about their health-care choices, the abundance of options also can be baffling, says Kathleen Stoll, deputy director of Families USA. The group is a nonprofit, nonpartisan health care advocacy organization that regularly advises consumers on choosing insurance coverage plans. \"People weigh the costs of deductibles versus premiums, and these options can be confusing. They are asking themselves, 'What is it that I can afford in the family budget?' I sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [insurance] coverage because that's all they can afford,\" Stoll told CNN. The survey also underscored Americans' receptiveness to innovations that potentially lower costs and offer greater convenience, pointing toward growing preferences for options such as retail walk-in primary care clinics in drug stores, medical tourism (high-quality, relatively inexpensive medical procedures obtained abroad) and Web-based medical services (often referred to as e-visits). Sampling a nationally representative group of more than 4,000 adults using a Web-based questionnaire, the survey was funded by the center's parent company, Deloitte LLP, which has a wide range of clients in the health care industry. The center released its first version of the annual survey results in 2008. Last month, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released its own health-care survey findings, with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments. According to the report, more than half of American households scaled back health-care spending in the previous 12 months before the survey, which was conducted in early February. Families relied on home remedies and over-the-counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time, and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time.",

        "article": "The death toll from a landslide that buried three villages in eastern Uganda stood at 18 Tuesday, and rescue officials fear the figure will rise. Another nine were injured and countless more may be missing, the Red Cross said. Heavy rains sent rocks and mud crashing down on the villages in the mountainous district of Bududa on Monday, about 275 kilometers (170 miles) northeast of the capital Kampala. At least 15 homes were destroyed, said Catherine Ntabadde of the Uganda Red Cross Society. \"Last night district authorities requested all people in high risk places to move to a school that we are using as a primary camp,\"  Ntabadde said Tuesday. No bodies have been recovered due to the heavy debris that has buried some of the victims 100 meters deep, Ntabadde said. Additional equipment is expected to arrive in the remote area Wednesday to assist in the excavation. Landslide kills 25 on Philippine island ravaged by rain . The Red Cross is working alongside members of the Ugandan army to relocate more than 1,000 people. \"People are a bit reluctant to move until an incident like this happens. People want to stay near their homes and find out what happened to their loved ones and their belongings,\" Ntabadde said. Torrential downpours regularly cause landslides in the eastern part of the country, particularly in areas where heavy logging has left the land stripped of vegetation. Last August, at least 23 people died when a massive landslide swallowed homes in the Bulambuli district, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Kampala. In 2010, another landslide in the same region killed at least 87. Rain, terrain slow recovery efforts after Uganda landslide .",

        "article": "Libyans poured into the streets Thursday to celebrate the death of  Moammar Gadhafi. After months of intense fighting, rebel fighters finally overran Gadhafi's last stronghold in his hometown of Sirte, marking the end of his 42-year rule. Although Gadhafi's rule effectively ended two months ago when he fled Tripoli, his death provides closure and a sense of relief to many in the country who had opposed his tyrannical rule. It also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by Gadhafi loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system. The challenges ahead are great: Since the Gadhafi regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere, Libya has no real civil society or effective political institutions. After decades of tyranny, there is a deep distrust of government. There is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under Gadhafi's brutality. Tensions are already evident between Islamists and secularists, and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense. Well-armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army; large caches of arms, including some sophisticated missiles, are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists. Nevertheless, of all the Arab states that have been convulsed by revolts this year, Libya has by far the strongest economic prospects. Its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens. Just recently, the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $23 billion  in the Central Bank of Libya, enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months. It has an additional $160 billion in foreign assets, which are  frozen overseas but will eventually be released. Libya also has a relatively well-educated population. Public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under Gadhafi, and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90%. In the 2007-2008 school year, women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly. According to the Transitional National Council constitution, legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation. The constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government, a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body. So far, transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision, but jockeying for power has only just begun. Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jabril, American educated and unabashedly secular, announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting, but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise, or if he does, who will succeed him. Jabril and Ali Tarhouni, the acting Finance and Oil Minister who was teaching economics in the United States before joining the rebellion, have been criticized for being outsiders, too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime. Some are pointing to Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the NTC commander of the militia in Tripoli, as a major player in the future political field. Belhaj was arrested in 2004 by the Central Intelligence Agency and rendered to Libya, where he was held and tortured in the infamous Abu Salim prison. The warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to al Qaeda, which he has denied. Belhaj has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance. Islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in Libya's new government, and outward signs of Islamic piety, suppressed under Gadhafi, are now on the rise across the country. But leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance. Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the transitional council, has called for a Libyan state founded on Sharia that is also inclusive of women and minorities. U.S. and European support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among Libyans for NATO countries, which points to a possible Western-aligned Libyan government that is nonetheless markedly Islamic in character. Gadhafi's death marks an important moment of transition for Libyans. Reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point, especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and Gadhafi loyalists. As demonstrated painfully in Iraq, lasting stability requires opportunities for Gadhafi supporters to participate in the new order, but with war wounds still fresh, this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders. A stable, prosperous Libya undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.  This helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of Gadhafi's death. The era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end. Protesters in Syria and Yemen held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way.",

        "article": "By . Steph Cockroft . Tremayne Gaskell, 46, from Leeds, has been jailed for life for raping the pensioner and robbing her jewellery after meeting at a pub in the city . A sexual predator who tied up and raped a pensioner in her own home while threatening her at knifepoint has been jailed for life. Tremayne Gaskell, from Leeds, already had an 'atrocious' criminal record for violence against women when he targeted the 68-year-old at a pub in Leeds in February this year. The 46-year-old, who was described in court as 'dangerous', then went back to the woman's home where he locked the door, tied her up with tape and stole her jewellery. He then subjected her to horrific sex attacks in an ordeal which did not end until the next morning. At the time of the brutal attack, Gaskell was out of jail on licence after being locked up in September 2012 for stabbing another woman in the face and neck. In a victim impact statement, the woman said she had been so disturbed by the incident that she had moved out of her home and left behind most of her belongings 'that this man had touched'. Gaskell has now been jailed for life after a jury at Leeds Crown Court found him guilty of two offences of rape and one of robbery. The jury of nine women and three men rejected his claims during the trial that his victim had consented to sex. Gaskell, who was arrested two days after . the attack, was told he must serve a minimum of nine years in prison . before he can apply to the parole board for release. Judge James Spencer told him: 'It was cruel. It was nasty, and it shows you for what you are. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. Dangerous in the sense that if you are at large you are ever likely to commit offences of this kind and commit serious physical harm to another human being.' The court heard Gaskell armed himself with the knife before targeting the 'trusting and vulnerable' victim when they met during a night out. Prosecutors also told the jury how the defendant had a long criminal history of serious . violent offences. One attack involved a woman suffering an eye injury . when she was struck in the face with a pistol, while the attack for which he was on licence had led to a three-and-a-half year prison sentence. The court also heard that Gaskell had spent almost every day of his life in prison since 2002. The victim said: 'Since this man did this to me I haven\u2019t been right. Leeds Crown Court heard that Gaskell was out of jail on licence for stabbing another woman in the face and neck when the brutal attack took place . 'I get upset and I end up crying and I can\u2019t sleep at night and I\u2019ve had to stay at my sister\u2019s because I just can\u2019t settle on my own at home. 'I can\u2019t even say what it is that makes me cry but the things this man did to me ran through my mind and I am really frightened. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. If you are at large... you are ever likely to commit serious physical harm to another human being' Judge James Spencer . 'After the incident I didn\u2019t go back into my house, which had been my home for five years. I was too scared. I am frightened of him coming back because he said that if I told anyone he would come looking for me and would kill me. 'It is because of this I have given up my home and moved out of the area. 'I did not even take anything out of the house other than my clothes, microwave and stereo as I couldn\u2019t face having the same things in my new home that this man had touched because this would remind me every day about the horrible and nasty things this man had done to me.' Det Chief Inspector Mark Griffin, who heads Leeds District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'These offences clearly show that Gaskell is a sexual predator who presents a serious danger to women. 'We believe he cynically preyed on the vulnerable victim from the outset and had sinister intentions towards her all along. She was put through a prolonged ordeal which has understandably had a lasting traumatic effect on her. 'Police enquiries quickly identified Gaskell as the suspect for these offences and he was traced to the city centre and arrested the next day after being recognised by officers patrolling the area. 'A full and thorough investigation by specialist safeguarding officers has seen him brought to justice and we hope the fact he has now had to answer for his crimes will provide some source of comfort to the victim.'",

        "article": "At least 45 people were killed and 60 others wounded Sunday when a suicide bomber attacked a crowd watching a volleyball match in the Yahyakhil district of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktika province, according to a spokesman for the provincial governor. In 2010, a suicide car bomb exploded in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball, a popular sport in the region, in northwest Pakistan. That attack left 30 people dead and 52 wounded. Sunday's attack comes the same day the nation's parliament agreed to allow U.S. and NATO forces to remain in Afghanistan after 2014. It's unusual for an attack in Afghanistan to kill so many people. Only a few comparable incidents come up in the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database, which tracks acts of terror from 1970 to 2013. In October 2012, a suicide bomber dressed in a police uniform attacked a mosque in the city of Maymana in Faryab province, according to the database. At least 42 people, including 19 members of the Afghan security forces, were killed and another 50 people injured in that blast. No group claimed responsibility for the incident, but sources attributed it to the Taliban. In April 2013, nine attackers dressed as soldiers killed 53 people at a courthouse complex where several Taliban members were standing trial in the city of Farah. At least one suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the entrance to the complex, while the other attackers entered other buildings and began shooting and throwing grenades. About 93 additional people were wounded. All of the attackers died, Global Terrorism Database reports. The Taliban said it was behind the carnage.",

They have something in common, beyond the fact that they've all run for president before or might in 2016. Like the NRA itself, they all camp out on the conservative fringe but are nevertheless convinced that they represent the mainstream. Perry, who calls Social Security \"a monstrous lie\" and has flirted in the past with the idea that Texas should secede from the United States, thought that what Americans wanted in a president was Yosemite Sam without the intellectual pretensions. Turned out, not so much. Jindal recently suffered a political setback when he proposed cutting the (progressive) income tax and raising the (regressive) sales tax, I guess because poor people in Louisiana have just been having it too easy. Even his conservative state recoiled, and Jindal's approval ratings plummeted. Cruz has cut a McCarthyite swath through Washington in his four months there, leading to rare agreement between Republicans and Democrats that he's an enormous jerk. Naturally, he's seriously considering a run for president in 2016. And as for the former half-term governor of Alaska? Well, you already know about her. All of them believe they represent the real America, and if the country just had a chance to hear their unvarnished views, they could win the White House with ease. That most real Americans find that idea either laughable or terrifying doesn't seem to register with them. They're right at home with the NRA, which just selected as its president a man who still refers to the Civil War as \"the war of Northern aggression,\" and has such a twisted view of liberty that he believes the freedom to buy an AR-15 at a gun show without having to fill out a form is as important as freedom of speech or religion. Eighteen years ago, after a right-wing anti-government extremist bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 men, women and children, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre railed against the threat from \"jackbooted government thugs\" in \"Nazi bucket helmets.\" In response, former President George H.W. Bush wrote the group an outraged letter defending those who work for the government, including one Secret Service agent killed in Oklahoma City who had worked on Bush's detail in the White House. \"He was no Nazi,\" Bush wrote, and resigned his NRA life membership in disgust. In the time since, the NRA has become even more extreme, even more paranoid, even more ensconced in its self-reinforcing world in which guns are all that matter. There may be a few Republicans who now have the courage to stand up to them. But there are still plenty such as Perry, Cruz and Palin, who will troop to their convention and jump into their festering pool of anger and fear. They don't seem to realize how it makes them smell.

        "summary": "Mean U.S. would not be held responsible, says Israel .",
        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:25 AM on 29th February 2012 . Israel said it will not warn the U.S. if it decides to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, American intelligence has revealed. Officials said they would keep America in the dark so that the U.S. would not be held responsible for failing to stop the attack. The pronouncement, delivered in a series of private, top-level conversations, sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the White House and Capitol Hill. No warning: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) will not be told if Israel decides to launch a strike on Iran, Israel PM Benjamin Netanhyhu (right) has said . Decision: Israel has said it will not tell the U.S. in order to decrease the chance Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will blame America for the strike . The U.S. has been working with the Israelis for months to persuade them that an attack would be only a temporary setback to Iran's nuclear programme. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak delivered the message to a series of top-level U.S. visitors to the country. They included the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House national security adviser, the director of national intelligence, and top U.S. lawmakers. All were trying to close the trust gap between Israel and the U.S. over how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu delivered the same message to all the Americans who have travelled to Israel for talks, the U.S. official said in an off-the-record briefing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Pentagon and Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy. Secretive: Iran says it is developing nuclear technology for fuel reasons, but a lack of transparency has led Western powers to be suspicious . Iran claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised alarm that its uranium enrichment programme might be a precursor to building nuclear weapons. The U.S. has said it does not know whether the Iranian government has decided to 'weaponise' its nuclear material and put it on a missile or other delivery device. The Iranian government has hailed the success of a homegrown film at Sunday's Academy Awards as a victory over Israel. 'A Separation' by director Asghar Farhadi won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Picture beating Israeli director Joseph Cedar's 'Footnote'. In a state TV broadcast Javad Shamaghdari, head of the state Cinematic Agency, hailed the win as the 'beginning of the collapse' of Israeli influence that 'beats the drum of war' in the U.S. and elsewhere. He later claimed the Oscar meant 'American judgment was bowed to the Iranian culture'. The film explores troubles in Iranian society through the story of a collapsing marriage. It tells the story of a couple heading for divorce and dealing with domestic troubles, including a young child and an aging parent. Iranian conservatives were upset with the themes of domestic turmoil, gender inequality and the desire by many Iranians to leave the country. In his acceptance speech Mr Farhadi said he hoped the Oscar would raise awareness of Iran's sizable artistic achievements and rich culture that has been 'hidden under the heavy dust of politics'. Surprisingly the film has been a huge hit in Israel, where tens of thousands of movie-goers have flocked to see it since it opened earlier this month. The secret warning is likely to worry U.S. officials and begin the high level meetings with Israel and the U.S. far apart on how to handle Iran. But the apparent decision to keep the U.S. in the dark also stems from Israel's frustration with the White House. After a visit by National Security Adviser Tom Donilon in particular, they became convinced the Americans would neither take military action, nor go along with unilateral action by Israel against Iran. The Israelis concluded they would have to conduct a strike unilaterally - a point they are likely to hammer home in a series of meetings over the next two weeks in Washington, the official said. Barak will meet with top administration and congressional officials during his visit.\u00a0 Netanyahu arrives in Washington for meetings with President Barack Obama next week. The behind-the-scenes warning belies the publicly united front the two sides have attempted to craft with the shuttle diplomacy to each other's capitals. 'It's unprecedented outreach to Israel to make sure we are working together to develop the plan to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and to keep them from exporting terrorism,' said Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. He travelled there with the intelligence committee chairman, Republican Mike Rogers, to meet Israel's prime minister and defence minister, along with other officials. 'We talked about the fact that sanctions are working and they are going to get a lot more aggressive,' Ruppersberger added. They also discussed talked about presenting a unified front to Iran, to counter the media reports that the two countries are at odds over how and when to attack. Programme: The nuclear enrichment facility in the central Iranian city of Natanz . He said: 'We have to learn from North Korea. All those (peace) talks and stalling and they developed a nuclear weapon. 'We are going to send a message, enough is enough, the stalling is over. ... All options are on the table.' Rogers told CNN yesterday: 'I got the sense that Israel is incredibly serious about a strike on their nuclear weapons programme. 'It's their calculus that the administration ... is not serious about a real military consequence to Iran moving forward. 'They believe they're going to have to make a decision on their own, given the current posture of the United States.' U.S. intelligence and special operations officials have tried to keep a dialogue going with Israel, despite the high-level impasse. They have shared with them options such as allowing Israel to use U.S. bases in the region from which to launch such a strike, as a way to make sure the Israelis give the Americans a heads-up, according to the U.S. official. Co-operation has improved on sharing of intelligence in the region, according to one current and one former U.S. official. Israel is providing key information on Syria for instance, now that the U.S. has closed its embassy and pulled out both its diplomats and intelligence officials stationed there, the U.S. official said.",

Australian police today admitted that it may be impossible to recover the bodies of all 298 victims as intense fighting forced international investigators back from the crash site for a second time. The delegation of Australian and Dutch police and forensic experts stopped in Shakhtarsk, a town around 20 miles from the fields where the aircraft was downed, amid sounds of explosions. A high-rise apartment block in the town was hit by at least two rounds of artillery, according to reports and dozens of families living in the area fled. Pro-Russian rebels admitted they had lost control of part of the crash site.

Russian-backed separatists have agreed to allow an unarmed international police team to recover more bodies and start a forensic examination of wreckage. In all, some 170 unarmed AFP officers have been deployed in Ukraine as part of the recovery effort. A total of 298 people, including 37 Australian residents and citizens, were killed in the disaster. The development comes as UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine may constitute a 'war crime'.

Separatist officials have staunchly denied responsibility . for shooting down the airliner and killing all 298 people on board. News that investigators were unable to reach the crash site for a second day comes as the UN said it was considering whether to classify the downing of MH17 as a war crime. Human rights chief Navi Pillay spoke out to say taking down to plane with a surface to air missile could constitute a war crime.

A Ukrainian security spokesman said data from the recovered flight recorders shows Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed due to a massive, explosive loss of pressure after being punctured multiple times by shrapnel. Andrei Lysenko said the plane suffered 'massive explosive decompression' after it was hit by fragments he said came from a missile. The data recorders were sent to UK experts for examination. In their campaign to take control over more territory from separatist forces, Ukraine's army has deployed a growing amount of heavy weaponry. Rebels have also been able to secure large quantities of powerful weapons, much of which the United States and Ukraine maintain is being supplied by Russia. Moscow denies the claims. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report that at least 1,129 people have been killed between mid-April, when fighting began, and July 26. The report said at least 3,442 people had been wounded and more than 100,000 people had left their homes. A UN report from mid-June put the death toll at 356.

Rebel leader Alexander Boroday accused Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko of starting a new military offensive to hide the truth about the downing of MH17. Intensified combat operations 'are irrefutable evidence proving that Kiev is seeking to destroy all evidence of the crime committed by its military,' he alleged. 'The junta is in panic, the only thing that matters for them today is to evade exposure. 'Kiev's actions run counter to Poroshenko's decision to declare a 40-kilometre zone around the crash site a ceasefire territory.' Ukrainian military analyst Dmitry Tymchuk today alleged that rebels were sneaking back dressed as civilians into areas 'liberated' by the Ukrainian army. 'The activity of the enemy's sabotage groups is high,' he said.",

        "article": "The Australian man who drowned at the weekend off a luxurious resort in Fiji has been identified as 37-year-old Melbourne tourist Benjamin John Busbridge. A Fijian police source told MailOnline Mr Busbridge died of 'asphyxiation due to drowning' and that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death. He added that the investigation into the drowning had concluded. Trouble in paradise: Benjamin John Busbridge, 37, drowned on Saturday night while snorkeling near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji . It is believed Mr Busbridge drowned on Saturday night after venturing out for a lone snorkeling trip near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji's Viti Levu island. He was last seen walking along the beach on Saturday afternoon. The alarm was raised when he failed to return his snorkeling gear to the resort that night. His body washed up on a coral reef about 1.5km from the resort at 9.50am on Sunday. The resort's general manager Peter Hopgood told MailOnline Mr Busbridge had been staying with a female guest - named by police as Melbourne-based Taiwanese national Hsu Yen Chun\u00a0 - and that she had since checked out. Mystery drowning: How Mr Busbridge drowned remained unclear. He had only booked one night's accommodation at the Outrigger resort . He said he was waiting on the coroner's report before making further comment. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the incident and was working with local consular officials to have the man's body returned to Australia. The Outrigger on the Lagoon resort offers some of Fiji's finest and most exclusive accommodation, with weekend rooms starting at $240 per night. Mr Busbridge and his female acquaintance had only booked one night at the resort - a popular destination for Australian tourists roughly 80km from Nadi. His death comes just days after Sydney father-of-three Mark Hardaker died in a collision between two boats while holidaying with his family in Fiji on May 15.

        "summary": "The new indictment, filed on Friday, .\nessentially reinstates recently-dismissed charges against the .\ndiplomat Devyani Khobragade .\nKhobragade is back in India and extradition appears unlikely .",
        "article": "By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:20 EST, 14 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 14 March 2014 . An Indian diplomat was re-indicted today on U.S. visa fraud charges that touched off an international furore after she was arrested and strip-searched last year. The new indictment, filed on Friday, essentially just reinstates recently-dismissed charges against the diplomat Devyani Khobragade - charges that now arrive with her out of the country. A judge threw out last year's virtually identical indictment on Wednesday on diplomatic immunity grounds, but the ruling left a door open to reviving the case and federal prosecutors quickly suggested they would. It accuses Khobragade of lying to the U.S. government to get her housekeeper a work visa. Scroll down for video . Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade (center) pictured with her father Uttam Khobragade (left) in January has been re-indicted in the U.S. today after visa fraud charges against her were recently dismissed . Khobragade's lawyer, Daniel Arshack, had no immediate comment on Friday. He said on Wednesday that re-indicting his client 'might be viewed an aggressive act and one that (prosecutors) would be ill-advised to pursue'. Khobragade is back in India. There was no immediate response to messages left at India's embassy in Washington and consulate in New York. It's unclear when, if ever, she might appear in court in New York again. It's unlikely she would ever be forced to appear through extradition. The U.S. State Department had filed court papers opposing Khobragade's bid to get the charges dismissed and stands by it, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Friday in Washington. Khobragade was a deputy consul general in New York when she was arrested in December near her children's Manhattan school. Prosecutors say she told the government she was paying her Indian housekeeper $4,500 per month while actually paying her less than $3 per hour and often making her work up to 100 hours a week. 'Khobragade did not want to pay the victim the required wages under law or provide the victim with other protections against exploitative work conditions mandated by U.S. law,' the indictment says. In the initial case, she pleaded not guilty and argued she was immune from prosecution. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi last year saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade . The arrest sparked an outcry in India, particularly because of the strip-search. The U.S. Marshals said Khobragade was treated no differently than others who are arrested, and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said she indeed was afforded courtesies most Americans wouldn't get, such as being allowed to make phone calls for two hours to arrange child care and sort out personal matters. Bharara, who is himself Indian-born, also said Khobragade wasn't handcuffed, restrained or arrested in front of her children and was given coffee and offered food while detained. And he questioned why there was such a furor over what Khobragade experienced but 'precious little outrage' over how the housekeeper was allegedly treated. Still, many in India saw the arrest as deeply disrespectful. Indian officials also said the housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, had tried to blackmail the diplomat; Richard's advocates disputed that. Safe Horizon, an anti-human-trafficking group that represents Richard, said earlier this week it hoped Khobragade would face a new indictment, calling the case 'a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate our nation's commitment to fighting exploitation of workers'. The arrest roiled U.S.-Indian relations, with India taking such steps as removing concrete traffic barriers around the U.S. Embassy and revoking diplomats' ID cards. After being indicted, Khobragade complied with a Department of State request to leave the U.S., and the Indian government then asked Washington to withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. complied. Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States . When Khobragade was arrested, U.S. officials said her status as a consular officer provided immunity limited to acts performed in the exercise of official functions. She disagreed. Then, on the day before her Jan. 9 indictment, she was accredited to India's U.N. mission, a role that conferred wider immunity. U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin decided in a ruling Wednesday that the later appointment gave Khobragade immunity when indicted and meant that indictment had to be dismissed, without settling the question of whether the alleged crimes would have been considered \"official acts\" covered by the earlier, more limited immunity. But the judge wrote that there was 'no bar to a new indictment against Khobragade', whose immunity ended when she left the country. She still works in foreign affairs for the Indian government, but now in New Delhi, according to Arshack.",

They put a smile on the faces of generations of children. But these must-have Christmas toys have left many parents in a cold sweat over the past 50 years. The items were often in such high demand that shoppers struggled to find them in time for December 25. Cabbage Patch Dolls were a firm favourite in the list. Originally made in the eighties, the toys were relaunched in 2004 (left) Debenhams has compiled a list of the top ten Christmas toys of the past five decades, based on the store\u2019s takings for them each year. Top of Santa\u2019s deliveries were Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the soft toys with pudgy faces, which today sell for up to \u00a330. Created by American art student Xavier Roberts in 1978, they dominated toy charts through the 1980s and remain popular. The fiendishly difficult Rubik\u2019s Cube took second place. The puzzle, invented in 1974 by Hungarian professor of architecture Erno Rubik, became a craze in British school playgrounds. The biggest selling toy in 1987, Sylvanian Families, made a slight comeback in the digital age. It claimed tenth place on the Debenham's list . The infuriatingly tricky Rubiks Cube invented in 1974 is still a popular choice according to the research . Third place went to Monopoly, the board game which can trace its roots back to 1903 when it was invented by an American woman, Lizzie Philips. Her goal was to create an educational tool to explain tax theory and it was not until 1933 that it was launched by Parker Brothers as a family game. It has been updated over the generations and even this year a new version, featuring big brand names like Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s, is tipped to be a success. Behind Monopoly come Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle figures, also still popular, followed by a Buzz Lightyear robot figure from the Toy Story films. In 1996, the year the first film was released in the UK, the demand for Buzz Lightyear toys had parents touring high streets desperate to find one. It was a pattern followed in later years for the Teletubby soft toys from the popular pre-school BBC series and the owl-like Furby. Dolls inspired by the popular nineties television programme, Teletubbies, were also featured on the list put together by Debenhams . The original barbie 1959 (left) and a more recent model (right). The toy is one of the most famous in the world . Family favourite Monopoly was third on the list. The game was first made in 1936, and has been adapted and modified ever since . 1.

But the brand also maintains strong sales throughout the year. James Ford, toy buyer for Debenhams, said: \u2018Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Lego are still as popular today as they were when they first launched. 'These brands have stood the test of time.\u2019 But he said there has been a shift towards hi-tech gifts, such as the \u00a390 Kurio 4S touch tablet. Film and television characters such as Buzz Lightyear (left) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (right) beat the shift towards high-tech gifts .

Clevenger, who had only become mayor earlier this month, told KSPR that he had known Cross, who lived nearby, for years. \u2018I kind of agreed with him on some things, but I don't like to express that too much,\u2019 said Clevenger. \u2018There's some things going on in this country that are destroying us. We've got a false economy and some of those corporations are run by Jews. The names are there.\u2019 At a meeting of the Marionville Board of Aldermen on Monday, local residents took Clevenger to task over his comments and the board voted 4-1 to begin impeachment proceedings against him. Avowed white supremacist Cross, 73, shouted 'heil Hitler' at TV cameras as he was arrested . In his resignation letter to the board on Tuesday, Clevenger did not explain why he was stepping down, writing only: \u2018I, Daniel R. Clevenger, do hereby resign as mayor of Marionville.\u2019 His remarks had already promoted the local district attorney and an assembly woman to stand down. Avowed white supremacist Cross, also known as Glenn Miller, has been charged with the killings of Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City on Sunday 13 April. Cross shouted \u2018heil Hitler\u2019 at television cameras as he was arrested after the shootings. The three people killed were Terri LaManno, left, and Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson Reat Griffin Underwood - all three victims were Christian . He is also accused of killing Terri LaManno at a nearby Jewish retirement complex shortly after the shootings at the Jewish Community Center. All three victims were Christian. Cross now faces a state charge of capital murder for the deaths of Corporon and Underwood and a count of first-degree premeditated murder for LaManno's death. The charges carry the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond. Corporon and Underwood were at the JCC for the 'KC Superstar' competition, an American Idol-like singing contest for students. LaManno worked as an occupational therapist at the Children's Center for the Visually Impaired. Video: Mayor steps down over anti-Semitic comments .",

        "summary": "NEW: Registration for tickets to singer's memorial service closes .\nMichael Jackson's family deciding whether to bring body to public service .\nFamily has not announced any plans for his burial .\nJournalists stake out possible locations of singer's burial .",
        "article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- About 1.6 million fans registered for a chance at fewer than 9,000 pairs of tickets to Michael Jackson's memorial service next week, organizers said. Some memorial tickets went out to \"friends and family\" on Sunday. Registration ended at 6 p.m. Saturday. Officials will now \"scrub\" all entries to eliminate duplicates and those they suspect may have been registered using software that ticket scalpers use to generate multiple hits. A random drawing will follow. The winning 8,750 registrants will receive an e-mail Sunday after 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET), AEG Live said. \"I know I'll be hitting the 'refresh' button on my inbox over and over again,\" said Jackie Flower, an arts student in San Diego, California. The e-mail will assign the selected registrants a unique code and direct them to a designated distribution center away from the Staples Center. There, they will each receive two tickets to either the memorial service at the Staples Center arena or a simulcast of the event at the adjacent Nokia Theater LA Live, AEG said. Jackson's family has still not announced the singer's burial arrangements, saying only that it will hold a private ceremony ahead of the massive public memorial service Tuesday. Journalists staked out several possible burial locations. A long line of television satellite trucks remained parked outside the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Cemetery in case it was chosen by the family, but there has been no word from cemetery officials. Police set up metal barricades around the front lawn, creating spaces for media and fans. Two state trooper cruisers idled at the Hall of Liberty inside the grounds, which contains a 1,200-seat auditorium.   Watch reporters prepare for Tuesday's service \u00bb . The family has not decided whether Jackson's body will be brought to the Staples Center arena, where the public ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. PT. At the time of his death, Jackson was working with a concert promotions company on 50 sold-out shows in London, England, beginning in mid-July. Also Saturday, a handful of fans milled about the Jackson family home in Encino, California, bringing flowers and taking pictures next to an informal sidewalk shrine to the pop star. Farzana Payind of Los Angeles snapped a picture of her 6-year-old daughter, Enayah. Payind said Enayah loves to dance to Jackson songs \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller\" and cried when she learned of the singer's death. \"Does that mean his music died too?\" the girl asked, according to Payind. Neighbor Michael Singer watched the activities with interest. \"This makes Elvis look like nothing,\" he said. \"When you grow up with Michael Jackson's music pretty much your whole life, you feel like you lost a family member, and you have to go to the funeral,\" said Add Seymour of Atlanta, Georgia, who registered Friday morning and planned to fly out if picked. \"I got some frequent-flier miles just in case I wanted to do something wild and crazy -- and this is wild and crazy.\" Tickets will be handed out Monday outside the Staples Center, said Tim Leiweke, president of AEG Live. Ticketholders will also have wristbands to match their tickets, a precaution against people \"trying to take advantage\" of the system, he said. Although 11,000 seats are available for fans inside the Staples Center, another 6,500 can watch from the Nokia Theater site across the street, according to Leiweke. Police said they will close the area near the Staples Center to all those without a ticket. The family will provide a free live video feed to networks so it can be televised everywhere. \"I want to stress to those people who are coming, or are thinking about coming, to the city for this special event that you might want to consider watching this from the comfort of your home,\" said Councilwoman Jan Perry, the city's acting mayor while Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is out of the country. The city government will provide security for the event, despite a budget crisis, Perry said. Despite the interest surrounding the service, few details have emerged. Ken Ehrlich, known for producing the Grammy Awards, is producing the memorial show, his company said. And Kenny Ortega, who was to have co-directed Jackson's series of concerts in London this summer, will direct it. Singer Jennifer Hudson will be among the performers taking the stage, CNN has confirmed. Drug rumors swirl . Meanwhile, speculation that anesthetic drugs might have played a role in the singer's death June 25 continued to swell Friday after a Los Angeles law enforcement source told The Associated Press that investigators found Diprivan, a powerful sedative, in Jackson's home.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with physician who accompanied Jackson on tour \u00bb . Earlier in the week, a nutritionist, Cherilyn Lee, said Jackson pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects. And sources close to Jackson said Thursday that the pop icon traveled with what amounted to a mini-clinic, complete with an IV pole and an anesthesiologist who medicated the insomniac singer, during his HIStory world tour in the mid-90s. Authorities do not know what killed Jackson and await toxicology results, which are due back in two to three weeks. \"We are treating all unnamed sources as rumors. And, as we have stated before, we will not be responding to rumors or innuendo,\" said lawyers for Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray, on Friday. \"We are awaiting the facts to come out, and we will respond at that time.\" Los Angeles police have interviewed Murray, who apparently tried to revive the singer after he was found unconscious at his rented Holmby Hills estate. The department said it is now working with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the state Attorney General's Office as it looks into Jackson's death. \"For anything that has to do with drugs, the DEA are the experts on that,\" said Jim McDonnell, assistant police chief. \"And if you're looking at the prescription issues, where else would you go?\" CNN's Susan Roesgen, Allison Blakely, Jeff King, Denise Quan, Don Lemon, Kay Jones and Drew Griffin in Los Angeles, California, and Danielle Dellorto in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- British challenger Dereck Chisora has risked the wrath of WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko by slapping his opponent at the weigh-in ahead of their title fight on Saturday. Underdog Chisora struck Ukrainian Klitschko as the two went face-to-face after they had taken to the scales 24 hours prior to their bout in Munich. A stunned Klitschko took a step back after Chisora's slap before both fighters' entourages became involved in a brief scuffle. The 40-year-old, who has a record of 43 wins from 45 fights, vowed to take revenge on Chisora when the two square off in Germany. \"I'll be hitting him back tomorrow, in the ring,\" Klitschko told reporters. '\"He's not all there. Dereck is full of nervousness and I feel he is afraid, otherwise he would not have jumped back like he did. \"He hit me not like a boxer but like a woman, with an open hand. If he wants to fight properly, he must do that with his fists.\" Chisora pulled a similarly controversial stunt when he planted a kiss on Derek Baker before their fight in 2010. He then knocked Baker out in the second round of their bout. The 28-year-old has twice been scheduled to Klitschko only for the champion to pull out both times with injury. He has won 15 of his 17 professional fights and is a former British heavyweight champion. Vitali's brother Wladimir currently holds four heavyweight belts and beat another British heavyweight, David Haye, in his last fight. Wladimir is due to fight former cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck, from France, on March 3.",

        "article": "Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has admitted that he did take his alleged stalker, a Canadian actress, to dinner but insisted the meeting was 'strictly professional.' Genevieve Sabourin was . arrested on suspicion of stalking  after turning up outside the 30 Rock star's . apartment. She has now been released from jail and warned to stay away from him. The 40-year-old was seized by police after she made the journey from . Montreal to his Manhattan home just days after she had surprised him at Baldwin's holiday retreat in the Hamptons. Released: Genevieve Sabourin pictured walking out of Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday night . She is said to have flown into a rage after it emerged that Baldwin had become engaged to his girlfriend, yoga teacher Hilaria Thomas, 28, earlier this month. According to the criminal complaint, . the pair, who met on the set of a movie, dined 'briefly' together back in 2010. Sabourin\u2019s lawyer, Julie Sender, said at her client\u2019s arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court last night that the pair had a two-year relationship, although she did not say if it was sexual. 'They met. They had dinner. They had a mutual relationship, with texts, e-mails going in both directions,' the lawyer said.

Luxury journey: Lurene Joseph spent more than \u00a38,000 on a single trip to Boston to drum up investments for Leeds council . A council investment chief who spent over \u00a38,000 on a single trip to Boston has been defended by the board, calling it \u2018good value for money\u2019. Leeds council has supported the chief executive of its investment arm, despite recently slashing millions form its budget. Lurene Joseph, head of Leeds and Partners, spent a total \u00a38,340 on cab fares, flights and nights\u00a0 at a five star hotel during a trip to secure investments\u00a0 for Leeds in September last year.

        "summary": "Victorian marine wildlife response unit saved five entangled seals .\nThe department has responded to more than 200 calls since December .\nSome animals could not be save due to sickness, injury or entanglement .",
        "article": "By . Sarah Michael . and Ryan Lipman . Five seals in Victoria have been rescued after their necks became trapped in potentially fatal ropes, thanks to a new marine response unit. Graphic images released on Thursday  show the full extent of the damage caused by the plastic ropes which cut into the mammals' pelts and can cause the seals to die a slow, painful death from infection. The images, taken in December and January, show members of Melbourne Zoo's AGL Marine Response Unit saving the mostly young seals from entanglement. Scroll down for video . Second chance: A seal at Jan Juc, Victoria had a potentially fatal plastic rope caught around its neck and upper body removed by the Marine Response Unit . In the first image the Marine Response Unit is seen rescuing a seal at Jan Juc, near Torquay, after retrieving it in difficult conditions during a rising tide. The second image shows a seal at Chinaman's Hat in Port Phillip Bay suffering because a piece of packing tape was choking its neck. It was rescued and pictured just weeks later happy and back in the wild, with a shaved patch on its head so it could be identified. The fourth and fifth images show seals on the timbers at Chinaman's Hat, with one pictured with a tight rope around its neck. Seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers to relax in the sun, so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted. Seals are very curious and they instinctively play with floating objects in the water, such as seaweed. But when they play with floating rope or plastic it can loop around their neck, and they have no way of getting rid of it. A seal at Chinaman's Hat in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, suffers from a tight piece of packing tape fastened around its neck . The seal that was saved from choking on packing tape was pictured weeks after being rescued back in the wild. It had a shaved patch on its head so the Marine Response Unit could identify it . Local tour boat operators often spot seals that have become tangled in plastic and report them to the Marine Response Unit. Melbourne Zoo vet Meg Curnick, who was involved in the rescue of the seal suffering due to packing tape at Chinaman's Hat, said the operations can difficult because seals duck into the water if humans try to approach them. 'The only way to get hold of that seal is to anaesthetise it and the only way to do that is to dart it with a dart gun,' Dr Curnick said. 'Often they'll shoot it and the seal's first instinct is to go in the water. 'Everyone needs to keep an extremely eagle eye on the animal in the water as it's slowing down and becoming sedated to grab hold of it.' Dr Curnick said the rescues were very tricky and there was a lot of luck involved. A seal at Chinaman's Hat has a rope fastened tightly around its neck . 'Sometimes you'll try and help a seal that's entangled and it's even possible that they will drown which is a horrible, but when the alternative is dying a slow death from infection from cutting wounds it's preferred.' Dr Curnick said young seals often get entangled because they are so curious they inspect a lot of things in the water. But as they grow larger the plastic cuts into their pelts and can cause deadly infection. The new Marine Response Unit was established in October last year and has since responded to more than 200 calls about wildlife caught in trouble. Wild Sea Keeper and AGL Marine Response Unit Coordinator Mark Keenan described the results as very positive for Victorian marine wildlife. 'To be able to respond to so many calls for assistance in our first season has been terrific,' Mr Keenan said. Seals like to pull themselves up onto the timbers at Chinaman's Hat to relax in the sun, so it is a place where entangled seals are often spotted . 'We were able to save five seals from entanglement, but unfortunately there were also a number of cases involving entangled, sick, or injured seals that couldn\u2019t be saved.' At the time of its launch, Environment and Climate Change Minister Ryan Smith said the unit aimed to protect and care for Victoria's 'incredible marine wildlife.' The specialist unit is run of of Melbourne Zoo's Veterinary Department and head veterinarian Dr Michael Lynch said the marine response department had addressed an important need by becoming the state's first centralised point for marine wildlife welfare calls. Most marine wildlife calls are made in spring and summer coinciding with yearling seals being forced by their mothers to become fully independent as they prepare to give birth in November and December. Despite the work of the unit, some animals could not be save because of sickness, injury or entanglement .",

A hole in the middle lets you easily hold the camera while keeping the view of the cameras unobstructed. The camera can also be placed on top of Centr\u2019s dual-use mount. As you take footage software within the camera converts what the four cameras see into a single interactive video. Using Centr's software, you can then move and zoom around the video when you play it back. It has a whole host of applications, such as watching different parts of the action at sporting events or capturing moments with all of your friends in the shot. On batteries or the supplied battery pack it can shoot HD video for about 2 hours, or it can be used to take photos for five hours. The camera is compatible with an official app on iOS, with an Android app also in the works. The Centr camera allows you to get new views when taking video. As the video plays you can scroll and zoom around it with your mouse of finger, depending on what device you are using. The team are currently looking for funding on Kickstarter . Centr uses four HD cameras to capture footage, which is then stitched together by software into an interactive panoramic video. You can also record out of each camera individually if you don't want to shoot in 360-degrees . Four HD cameras are positioned around the ring. These each capture footage at 60fps with a 4K panoramic video resolution. Software in the camera stitches together the footage from each camera into a 360\u00b0 video. The videos are interactive, so you can move and zoom around while watching them. Each can be viewed on a computer, smartphone or tablet in real-time via Wi-Fi with Centr\u2019s interactive player. If you don\u2019t want to shoot in 360\u00b0 you can individually select one of the cameras. Centr can also take 20 megapixel time-lapse panoramic photos. The product seems to be a competitor with other \u2018on-the-go\u2019 cameras such as GoPro\u2019s devices. But Centr is the first to provide 360-degree capability. Their device has already attracted the attention of several companies including Fox and ESPN. It has also been picked up by the US Department of Defense, who have used the Centr camera in tandem with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) technology. In place of regular cameras, the battlefield version uses four FLIR camera on top of soldiers\u2019 helmets to record what\u2019s going on around them in infrared. This data can then be used by drones flying overhead to locate targets. And Centr say there could be many other applications for their camera. It will go on sale to the public in February 2015, with a retail price of $399 (\u00a3235).",

So single mother Samantha Welch was moved to tears when a generous stranger \u2013 impressed by her parenting of her three-year-old son Rylan \u2013 gave her \u00a35 with a letter praising her as a \u2018credit to her generation\u2019. The mystery passenger had written his message on a scrap of paper folded around the cash, which he handed to her as he got off the train. Scroll down for video . Good mother: Sammie Welch, pictured with son Rylan, was given \u00a35 by a stranger who saw them on a train . Note: The man left this letter praising Ms Welch for how she handled her three-year-old boy . The note said: \u2018Have a drink on me. You are a credit to your generation, polite and teaching the little boy good manners.\u2019 He signed off simply as \u2018man on the train at table with glasses and hat. Have a lovely evening.\u2019 The note went on: \u2018PS I have a daughter your age... Hope when she has children she is as good a mother as you!\u2019 Miss Welch, 23, had kept Rylan occupied by playing games and listening to music. He later fell asleep and when the train became busier she moved him on to her lap to free up a seat. She said yesterday that she was \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 by the man\u2019s gesture and has launched an appeal on Facebook to track him down so she can thank him in person. She explained: \u2018As he walked by he tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve dropped this out of your bag,\u201d handed me the note and got off. Family: Ms Welch and Rylan were travelling from Birmingham to Plymouth at the time of the incident . Bonding: The mother was feeding her son his dinner, and then encouraged him to give up his seat .

I was so moved, I was overwhelmed. It meant so much to me.\u2019 She added: \u2018He shows there are still good people out there and I want him to know I am truly grateful. We definitely do need more people like him \u2013 the world would be a great place.\u2019 Have a drink on me. You are a credit to your generation, polite and teaching the little boy good manners. Man on train at table with glasses and hat . Have a lovely evening. PS I have a daughter your age, someone did the same for her once. Hope when she has children she is as good a mother as you. Miss Welch and Rylan were on a gruelling five and a half hour journey, which included changing trains \u2013 enough to test even the most placid child\u2019s patience. She said: \u2018He was good and there was no crying. It was quite exhausting for him but then he fell asleep with his head on my knee. The train was quite busy. A couple of people got on and were standing up and I offered to put him on my knee so they could have a seat.\u2019 She had not really noticed the man until he gave her the note as he got off the train in Bristol, about an hour and half after she and Rylan had boarded in Birmingham. Miss Welch went on: \u2018People look at you and judge you every day when you\u2019re a single mum but getting that note made me feel special and proud. That might sound silly, but all I\u2019m trying to do is make a better life for my son. \u2018It really shocked me that there was money with the note, especially as money is tight for a lot of people these days.\u2019 She has put the cash into her son\u2019s savings account. Miss Welch recently moved to Plymouth from Crewe, Cheshire, where she worked as an IT technician. She is currently looking for a similar job. She and Rylan had visited her sister in Crewe and changed trains in Birmingham on the way home. They were on the 6.12pm train from Birmingham New Street to Plymouth on Thursday when she received the note. Are you the generous stranger?

The government has yet to confirm the detention of Kabas amid claims of deteriorating media freedoms in the country.

The government - pointing to an alleged plot to remove it from office by followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential US-based Muslim cleric - moved to reassign hundreds of police, prosecutors and judges, including those involved in the case. The case was later dropped, leading to accusations from the opposition of a cover-up. Meanwhile, a judicial body which oversees judges and prosecutors has suspended four prosecutors  who had initiated the corruption probes, pending the outcome of an investigation into whether they had abused their powers. The corruption scandal, which broke last year, implicated people close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) and led to the ouster of four ministers . The prosecutors, whom the government has accused of being close to Gulen, face possible ouster from their profession.

        "article": "By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 15:49 EST, 19 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:49 EST, 19 February 2013 . Burly: Enforcers Tony Lawrence and David Riddick, pictured looking back, went to Jeffrey Ashfield's home armed with a High Court writ taken out against the millionaire . A wealthy businessman threatened two bailiffs with a shotgun after they tricked their way into his country home to seize over \u00a31.2 million worth of property, a court heard. The burly enforcers went armed with a High Court writ taken out against millionaire Jeffrey Ashfield, director of a company that sells aircraft and parts. Tony Lawrence and David Riddick were refused entry when they arrived at the gates of 62-year-old Ashfield's home Hayselden Manor in Cranbrook, Kent, on July 31 last year. But they found a gap in bushes surrounding the property, knocked down a fence and managed to reach the front door. When Ashfield, whose business interests include Aircraft Avionics Parts Support Ltd, Aviation Capital Solutions Ltd and Chobham Engineering Ltd, answered the door he was served with the writ. He still refused entry but allowed them into the house to photocopy the writ. Once inside, Mr Lawrence and Mr Riddick saw their chance to start seizing property, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Mr Lawrence told a judge: 'I said: \"As I am in the house, we are going to have to levy on all the goods in the house.' 'Mr Ashfield was not very happy about this and said no, we couldn't. He tried to forcibly eject me. Mrs Ashfield appeared and asked us to leave. 'Mr Ashfield said if we didn't leave the premises he was going to get a gun. My colleague advised him it would not be a very good idea and if he did he would get himself in a lot of trouble. 'Mr Ashfield disappeared. Mrs Ashfield insisted we left and said we were trespassing and she would call the police. We told her we were not going to leave and if she wanted to call the police that was fine by us. 'Mr Ashfield appeared in the hallway with a double barrel shotgun. It was on his shoulder pointing in our direction in the firing position. Worrying: Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, was told that Mr Ashfield appeared in the hallway of his home with a double barrel shotgun . 'He said: \"Get out of my house.\" He pointed the gun towards my legs. He said: \"If you don't get out I am going to shoot you in the legs. 'My reaction was: \"That's fine, we will leave the house\". Asked by prosecutor Christopher May what was going through his mind, he replied: 'What was going through my mind was I was going to end up with no legs.' The bailiffs left the house, called the police and waited outside the gates. Mr Lawrence, who worked for Burlington Credit, denied a suggestion by William Clegg QC, defending, that they broke down a metre-high garden fence to get into the grounds. Mr Riddick said of the gun incident: 'I could see by his face he meant it. I was in a bit of a state and panicking. I was scared.' Mr Clegg told him: 'You could have been a couple of bandits.' Ashfield admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence but disputed that he aimed the gun at the bailiffs. His solicitor and son-in-law Lucas Pitts said the writ resulted from a civil action in which the businessman was one of the defendants. He said of the bailiffs: 'I said it sounded like trespass. Their aim was to empty the house of everything they could lay their hands on. It was an unwarranted and insane idea. 'There was a Derby Bentley in one of the garages. Their eyes lit up at that point. A low loader was ordered (to take it away).' The court heard Ashfield's wife Francesca had just finished breakfast when the bailiffs arrived. Oil had been stolen from their property the previous day. The gun was used by their son for clay pigeon shooting. Saying she felt 'extremely vulnerable', she maintained the bailiffs had broken in by forcing the stock fence and damaging the hawthorn and holly hedge. Mrs Ashfield said she repeatedly asked them to leave the house before her husband told them: 'If I get a gun would that persuade you to leave?' She heard him say: 'And now will you leave?' 'I looked over my right shoulder and he was pointing at the floor,' she added. She denied that her husband either pointed the gun at the men or threatened to shoot one of them in the legs. Ashfield was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work after Judge Martin Joy found he could not be sure what position the gun was held in. He said Ashfield, who also owns a gym in Brighton and is a co-driver in rallying with Vince Bristow, acted 'foolishly' by fetching the gun and could have calmed down at any stage. But he added the two bailiffs had been equally foolish, and even 'deceptive'. 'I do not find that the criminal standard of proof has been satisfied and I sentence on the basis that the defendant unwisely, foolishly, brought in a gun which was broken and not loaded,' said the judge. 'The defendant did by his actions threaten the two bailiffs and his actions were foolish, overdramatic, grandstanding and the bailiffs were behaving in a foolish and deceptive way and were not really frightened. 'All the parties over-reacted in what may be described as a childish and foolish way.' Judge Joy said Ashfield's behaviour would have caused fear but nothing like as first suggested by the bailiffs. He added that use of a firearm to threaten or intimidate could not be tolerated and there had to be a deterrent sentence. The bailiffs, he said, had broken into the property by knocking the fence down and going through the hedge. Their 'misbehaviour' went further and had fuelled the situation. He described them as 'incompetent and belligerent' and said it seemed remarkable to suggest they were experienced bailiffs. 'They lacked the professionalism and any understanding of the regulations concerning what they were permitted to do and their evidence was contradictory,' he said. 'Their attitude inflamed the situation and they went into the house completely uninvited. Mr Ashfield undoubtedly considered genuinely that he had been tricked, as he had.'",

Found: Mr Vickers died instantly in the crash next to the Airbus factory and Ms Clarke died later in hospital . Mr Vickers died instantly in the accident that afternoon. Miss Clarke survived the impact but died hours later in hospital. Her . devastated mother Angela, 66, said: \u2018They idolised each other and Gary . would never have put Kay\u2019s life in danger.

She was due at the doctor\u2019s at 3pm,\u2019 said Mrs Clarke. Disaster: This dramatic picture captures the moment the aircraft lands nose-first at the airport . Police were called to the scene at Hawarden Airport at about 1.10pm, where the wreckage was found .

Photographer Dale Morris said many lemurs live in nature reserves and are used to tourists . Not camera shy: Most lemurs take no notice of tourists snapping away but these individuals certainly took an interest in the cameras . Happy families: A pair of lemurs cling to a tree in Madagascar, left, while two babies stay close to their mother among the leaves, right . Curious: Two lemurs look suspicious as they crawl along the ground towards the camera, while a nervous companion pokes its head from behind a tree . Prickly situation: A lemur perches among the thorns in a tree, left, while another poses for the camera as it shows off its climbing skills . He said: 'Many of the daytime lemur species live in nature reserves and are quite accustomed to tourists taking their photos. 'They seem to get on with their daily business regardless of who is watching or taking photos of them. 'Some . of them are so used to people that they will raid your hotel room . looking for food if you leave the window open and will even beg at . open-air restaurants. 'A . Lemur did a poo down my shirt during one photo shoot. I also woke up in . my hotel room in Berenty reserve to find a troop of ring tailed lemurs . bouncing around on the bed with me. 'They scattered when I woke and shooed them away, but not before stealing my bananas and also my last packet of cigarettes - which I later found shredded and dumped in the forest.' On the look out: A ring-tailed lemur sits on the red earth. A troop of the species raided photographer Dale Morris's hotel room during his visit . Astounded: Dale Morris said he was amazed by the vast range of lemur species in Madagascar. There are more than 100 species on the island . Time for your close up: Dale Morris was able to shoot the lemurs at very close proximity both up trees and on the ground . Spectacular sight: The lemur's expressive face is shown in close detail in Dale Morris's photograph . A baby brown lemur looks on as it eats some food while staying close to its mother and a baby's face is captured close up . Mr Morris, a freelance nature . photographer from north London, also travelled to the spiky forests to . the south of the island to see species of lemur. It can be risky business as the trees are heavily spiked and branches easily break and fall when disturbed by the animals. Mr Morris added: 'I was surprised by how many beautiful lemur species there are - over 100 - and how many of them are close to extinction. ''I learned that once upon a time there were lemur species as large as a man. Now that would have been something to see.'",

        "summary": "Court declined to review two cases brought by National Rifle Association .\nThe decision is seens as a temporary setback for gun rights advocates .\nGun-control efforts have stalled in Congress despite Newtown and a string of other mass shootings .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- The Supreme Court for now is staying out of the hot-button issue of concealed weapons laws. The Justices on Monday declined to review two cases brought by the National Rifle Association that deal with whether those age 18-20 can buy and then carry handguns in public for self-defense. The justices gave no reason for denying those cases and a third gun-control appeal on out-of-state weapon transfers. The decision not to intervene means the state and federal laws at issue will remain in effect, and are at least a temporary setback for gun-rights advocates. The NRA had hoped the court was prepared to address a broader, politically explosive issue-- whether there was a fundamental constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public. The Supreme Court in 2008 said the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have a handgun in the home to protect life and property. Both current handgun cases originated in Texas, which included a challenge to state restrictions over \"concealed carry\" permits. At issue in NRA v. McCraw (13-390) was whether the right to bear arms in public for self-defense extends to responsible, law-abiding 18- to 20-year-olds. State law permits those 21 and older to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. Many states have similar restrictions, citing concerns over crime rates among certain young adults, and whether they have the necessary level of maturity and responsibility to carry a handgun. The second legal challenge dealt with a 1968 congressional law that restricts sales of handguns by federally-licensed firearms dealers only to those 21 and older. Those 18-to-20 may still be allowed to purchase shotguns and certain type of rifles, or receive handguns as a gift. Two young Texas gun owners-- Andrew Payne and Katherine Taggart-- had brought the original lawsuit in NRA v. ATF (13-137). Again, the nation's most powerful gun rights group failed to convince the high court to address whether a nationwide, class-based, categorical ban on meaningful access to exercise the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense violated the Second Amendment. The justices also turned down a more narrow appeal in Lane v. Holder (12-1401), denying gun owners in Washington D.C. the ability to sue over city laws making it hard to legally transfer weapons purchased in nearby jurisdictions. Since the nation's capital does not have any federally-licensed gun shops, residents seeking a handgun typically have to go to nearby Virginia or Maryland. Once the high court established an \"individual\" right to keep a handgun in the home, it has been reluctant to broaden that right in a variety of subsequent challenges to other firearm restrictions. The Justice Department estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the United States. In 2005, the last time figures were available, three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns. Paul Clement, a Washington lawyer challenging the federal restrictions on handgun sales to those under 21, expressed frustration at that reluctance. \"Given the number of laws enacted by the federal government, states, and localities in the years when a mistaken understanding of the Second Amendment held sway, one would have expected a major reconsideration of extant firearms laws to have occurred,\" said Clement in a brief filed with the court. \"Instead, jurisdictions have engaged in massive resistance to the clear import of those landmark decisions, and the lower federal courts, long out of the habit of taking the Second Amendment seriously, have largely facilitated the resistance,\" he said. Efforts to craft compromise gun-control legislation have stalled in Congress despite the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since. The high court six years ago -- for the first time -- affirmed an individual's right to own a firearm, when it struck down Washington D.C.'s handgun restrictions. But the court confined its analysis just to the home, leaving in place other gun control laws, including those \"forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools.\" While the court for now is staying out of the concealed carry issue, it may be forced back into the debate. Federal appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have issued opposite rulings in recent weeks.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Africa from the air is a breathtaking sight -- vast herds, sprawling wetlands, snow-capped peaks and rising cities. Thanks to creative safari outfitters, aerial views of the continent are a lot more accessible than they once were. The 11 options below showcase the best aerial tours of Africa. 1. Huey helicopter flights at Victoria Falls (Zambia) Based in Livingstone on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls (the falls form a border between Zambia and Zimbabwe), United Air Charters introduced 20-minute flights in a \"Huey\" helicopter -- the widely used military helicopter -- in 2013 as a radical way to experience Africa's largest waterfall. With fully open side doors, the 13-passenger Huey zigzags through the 125-meter-high (410 foot) rock walls of Batoka Gorge, skimming close to rapids that make this stretch of the Zambezi one of the continent's best for whitewater rafting. Upon reaching the violent clash of water and rock called Oblivion, the chopper rapidly rises up and over Mosi-oa-Tunya (\"The Smoke that Thunders\") at the falls. United Air Charters Huey tours over the falls with an open door are $175 per person for 15 minutes and $330 per person for 20 minutes . 2. Private flying safari (Namibia, Botswana) Little trumps the glamor of a private flying safari in southern Africa, which takes visitors over the Kalahari Desert and Okavango Delta and delivers them to some of the most exclusive and expensive safari camps on the continent. As one of the region's leading flying safari outfitters, African Profile Safaris lists corporate tycoons, politicians and movie stars among its clientele, and organizes flying safaris anywhere in Africa, from week-long trips around Namibia, Botswana and South Africa to month-long Cape-to-Cairo journeys. African Profile Safaris offers 13-day fly-in safaris in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia from 60,900 rand ($5,770) per person . 3. Table Mountain Cableway (South Africa) Table Mountain Cableway opened in 1929 as a vertigo-inducing way to rise from Cape Town to the 1,084-meter (3,558-foot) summit of the giant, flat-topped peak. In the late 1990s, the vintage cable cars were replaced by new pods that can carry 65 passengers and rotate 360 degrees. From the top of the mountain, visitors get breathtaking panoramas of central Cape Town, the beach towns along the western edge of the peninsula, the Cape of Good Hope stretching off to the south and the old prison on Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years. Table Mountain Cableway adult return journeys are 215 rand ($20) per person . 4. Nile High Bungee (Uganda) It took European explorers hundreds of years to come into contact with the source of the Nile. Now it can be done in a matter of seconds at Nile High Bungee. Located in the town of Jinja near the spot where the Lake Victoria turns into the world's longest river, the jump is 44 meters (144 feet) from platform to water. Tandem and night jumps are offered. Leapers can also choose a full dunk -- a brief submergence in the Nile. Nile High Bungee jumps start at $115 per person . 5. Skydiving (Kenya) An hour's drive south of Mombasa, Skydive Diani offers a year-round slate of tandem skydives, full training courses and solo jumps for qualified skydivers. Most jumps are over a permanent drop zone at Diani Beach, but the company runs tandem operations on the coasts of Malindi and Kilifi and in the central highlands outside Nairobi. Each March and November, Skydive Diani and the Nairobi-based Kenya Skydivers Association organize Beach Boogies, a week-long skydiving festival over the white sands and turquoise waters of Diani. Skydive Diani offers skydives from $350 per person . 6. Climbing the West Face at Mulanje (Malawi) Rising 1,700 meters (5,500 feet), the hulking West Face of Chambe peak on the Mulanje Massif is one of Africa's greatest rock-climbing challenges. The wall features two distinct sections -- a 610-meter (2,000-feet) Lower Face and a 1,067-meter (3,500-feet) Upper Face. Those who want to experience the view from the top without the death-defying climb can trek the Skyline Trail, a three-hour hike between Likhubula guest house and Chambe mountain hut. The Mountain Club of Malawi (MCM) offers tips on how to trek or climb Mulanje. Expect to pay around $162 per person for a week on the mountain. 7. Trekking Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) The six-day trek up and down Africa's highest mountain (5,895 meters/19,341 feet) is one of the continent's iconic adventures. The main routes to the top require no technical climbing experience, but trekkers should be in fairly good shape for an uphill walk that takes three and a half days. Above 11,000 feet, head aches, shortness of breath and other symptoms of altitude sickness are common, and pulmonary edema is a real danger. Tanzania's National Parks Authority requires that all climbers be accompanied by a licensed guide. Ultimate Kilimanjaro offers seven ways to reach the summit. Hikes start at $2,200 per person . 8. Busanga Plains hot air balloon trip (Zambia) \"There's nothing like it,\" says balloon pilot Erik Hesemans of the low-level gliding he does over Zambia's wildlife-rich Busanga Plains with Namib Sky Balloon Safaris. \"Sometimes we're only three meters above the ground -- close enough to look straight into the face of a lion or hippo as you're flying past.\" Hesemans pioneered the maneuver over the red hot dunes of the Namib Desert and brought \"skimming\" to Zambia's savannah country in 2012. Hesemans brings his balloons to Busanga during the dry season between June and October, when animals are drawn to waterholes and are thus easier to spot from the air. See a video here. Busanga Bush Camp starts at $799 per person per night; hot air balloon safari is complimentary (and only) for guests who stay minimum three nights . 9. Microlight flights over Kruger National Park (South Africa) Microlights -- lightweight, fixed-wing aircraft -- have been a fixture at South Africa's Kruger National Park for more than a decade, offering bird's-eye views of elephant, rhino, buffalo and other African wildlife. Kwa Madwala Private Game Reserve on Kruger's south side is one of the few lodges with its own microlight -- a sturdy little Bantam that takes off from a grass runway. A six-cylinder engine powers the small aircraft on 15-minute, half-hour and hour-long flights over Kruger, including a glide down the Crocodile River. Kwa Madwala's Manyatta Rock Camp starts at 1,600 rand ($150) per person per night with microlight flights from 650 rand ($61) per person . 10. Cairo Tower (Egypt) Inspired by the lotus columns of the Temple of Luxor and other ancient monuments, Cairo Tower rises 187 meters (613 feet) above Egypt's brooding capital city and remains the third tallest building on the continent more than 50 years after it was first built. From the open-air observation deck at the top, visitors gaze down on central Cairo, up the Nile Valley to the Great Pyramid of Giza and across to the great citadel that dominates eastern Cairo. Cairo Tower observation deck access is 70 Egyptian pounds ($10) per person . 11. Tsitsikamma zipline (South Africa) Africa's best zipline soars through the extraordinary wilderness of Tsitsikamma, featuring an hour-long \"flight\" through the Kruis River Gorge over three waterfalls. The zigzag route features eight different \"slides\" or cables, one of them the length of two soccer fields. Thanks to a patented braking system, fliers can control their speed and come to a complete stop midway along the slides to take in indigenous flora and fauna. Tsitsikamma zipline rates are 350 rand ($33) per person . Joe Yogerst is a freelance travel, business and entertainment writer based out of California.",

The Spaniard, now ranked 49th, shot a sizzling eight-under-par 63 in the second round to go two shots clear at the Club de Campo del Mediterraneo club where he has played since he was a child.

Fins Swimming Club have expressed \u2018great sadness\u2019 at Gregor's death and passed on their sympathies to his family. Senior coach Graham Irvine said he was struggling to take the tragedy in. He said: \u2018Gregor had been at the club as long as I can remember and we were looking to develop him into an athlete as he moved through adolescence. Promising athlete: Gregor's peers within his swimming squad said he would be greatly missed . \u2018He will be missed greatly by his peers within the squad as they spend a considerable time with each other training and become more like family than friends. \u2018His confidence and cheeky ways will be how I remember him most as we come together as a club to try and come to terms with the pain and unfairness of his passing.\u2019 Derek Allan, Rector of Kirkcaldy High School where Gregor was a student, said today that both pupils and staff were shocked and saddened by his death. He said: \u2018Our thoughts are with his family and his many friends during this very difficult time. \u2018Gregor was a popular pupil, well known and liked by staff and pupils. He will be a huge loss to us all.\u2019 Mr Allan added: \u2018We have also set aside some quiet space in the school for pupils and staff, who are being comforted by our own staff and a Fife Council support team.\u2019 The school is liaising with Fife\u2019s public health team and all pupils have been given leaflets highlighting the symptoms of meningitis. However, it is thought to be very unlikely that any other pupils will contract the illness. Gregor\u2019s devastated parents, Jenny and George Smith, are now planning his funeral. His friends at Kirkcaldy High School are organising a sponsored walk to raise money for research into meningitis. Meningitis can kill in four hours. Classic symptoms include a headache, stiff neck and a dislike of bright light. Some suffers develop a rash that does not fade under pressure. To carry out the 'glass test' on a rash roll a clear glass over the affected area - if it does not fade seek immediate medical attention. Each year around 3,400 people contract bacterial meningitis and septicaemia (the blood poisoning form of the disease). Septicaemia symptoms include cold hands and feet, and the rash. 1 in 10 people die and 1 in 4 are left with permanent disabilities such as loss of limbs, scarring, loss of hearing or brain damage. Under-5s, those aged 14-24 and the elderly are most at risk.",

On this record, I wanted to bring the music I listened to offstage -- [Iggy Pop's] The Idiot, The Slider, Electric Warrior [both by T. Rex] -- into my music, which is pop music. Now, to some people, pop is a dirty word, or only a \"guilty pleasure.\" But I f**king love pop music. I always have, and I will 'til the day I die, and I want to make pop records. But I love bringing [rock's] balls and irreverence to my music as much as I can. I once said that I wanted to make \"c**k pop.\" And there are moments of that on the record, but there are also the quintessential Ke$ha moments like \"Come On\" -- rap-talking, s**t-talking -- and there are also moments that are unexpected, stripped-down and just me. As far as the people I collaborated with, I just wanted to take all my idols and make a record with them. Massive Beats, Wild Nights and Crazy Tattoos: Ke$ha Rocks Out on New Album . RS: How did you hook up with Iggy? What was it like to work with him? Ke$ha: Being in the studio with him was one of the most incredible days of my life -- definitely one of those \"holy s**t!\" moments. I've been obsessed with him forever. I remember when my brother brought home his record on vinyl. And then I started reading about him, and I was like, \"I f***ing love him.\" I just started asking everyone I know, pretty much, if any of them knew Iggy Pop, and this time it paid off. Ke$ha Memoir to Explore 'My Crazy Beautiful Life' RS: This has been a year when rock songs by the likes of fun. have crossed over to the pop charts. Do you see pop music embracing guitars more in 2013? Ke$ha: For me, bringing in rock was about making the perfect imperfect. When you're making songs electronically, it's easy to make them perfect -- you can change things to the microsecond, move the drums down, Auto-Tune everything. I wanted to keep the electronic elements while making things a little bit imperfect, which makes it feel more organic. I wanted to capture real moments in time. Photos: Ke$ha's Rock & Roll Party . RS: That reminds me of your collaboration with the Flaming Lips, which was so chaotic and balls-to-the-wall. On the EP that comes with Warrior, you cover the country track \"Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You,\" and I kind of see you as a pop outlaw. There's an idea that pop is glossy and perfect, and you're like, \"F**k it, I'm gonna do what I want.\" And as a result you have this really strong connection with your fans. Ke$ha: I love my fans. And I love that you called me a pop outlaw. \"Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You\" was written by my mom [Pebe Sebert], and made famous by Dolly Parton. Johnny Cash also sang that, and Merle Haggard, and they've both been famous for being the outlaw, or the misfit. RS: Are you going to be touring anytime soon, and if you are, are you bringing back the penis suit? Ke$ha: The penis suit is one of my favorite moments onstage. You don't understand the people who have been in that suit. Very famous people have worn it. My mother has been in that suit, friends, ex-boyfriends, lovers -- you name it, they've been in that suit. I can't imagine it going anywhere. See original story at RollingStone.com. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Rolling Stone.",

        "summary": "Boston-based company devises cups and straws that can detect date-rape drugs .\nWith the help of a chemistry professor, the company came up with a prototype .\nDrinkSavvy's funding campaign helped raise more than $50,000 .\nFounder Mike Abramson hopes to roll out completed products in early to mid-2014 .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- The pitch reads: \"Would you know if an odorless, colorless and tasteless rape drug were put in your drink? What if your cup, straw or glass changed color to warn you?\" The pitch comes from a group of people who've put their minds together to work toward developing a cup and straw that will change color in the presence of date-rape drugs. When substances like GHB, ketamine and Rohypnol touch the surface of the drinkware, they will turn into the designated color used to detect the drug, alerting you to its presence. In a video posted to YouTube to promote a funding campaign, DrinkSavvy Inc. founder Mike Abramson said the idea came from a bad experience where he was once \"roofied\" -- referring to Rohypnol, a sedative -- while out drinking with friends. \"Within the past three years, three of my very close friends, and myself, have been the unwitting victims of being drugged.\" He added, \"DrinkSavvy's ultimate goal is to use the success of this campaign to convince bars, clubs and colleges to make DrinkSavvy the new safety standard and eventually make drug-facilitated sexual assault a crime of the past.\" Abramson says of his experience: He was at a club in Boston celebrating a friend's birthday and went to get a drink and then \"felt like I had 15 drinks. Luckily, friends were able to get me home safely.\" Afterward, he went to John McDonald, professor of chemistry at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where Abramson had attended college, with his idea to create a detection system. After about two years of research, a prototype was launched in the funding campaign. The Boston-based company started a campaign on Indiegogo in November 2012 with hopes to raise $50,000. The monthlong campaign resulted in more than 2,500 contributors surpassing their $50,000 goal and getting the company one step closer to making the product a reality. And Abramson is a finalist in the MassChallenge, an annual $1 million startup competition and accelerator program that helps entrepreneurs get access to mentors, marketing and other resources. Over the next few months, drink straws and, possibly, cups that can detect the anesthetic GHB will be sent out to the people who financially supported the campaign to get feedback. Abramson says the company also has done tests to detect Rohypnol and the anesthetic ketamine, and expects to roll out cups and straws that will detect all three drugs in early to mid-2014. At that point the products will also be available on the company's website. Watch a prototype demonstration on YouTube . One of the company's main goals is to get its products in bars and in the hands of college students. Abramson says they are in discussion with several colleges to make this new technology part of their rape-prevention initiatives. He said he is well aware that his company's products won't solve all the sexual assault problems, telling CNN \"this is not 100% fool-proof, it's not a cure-all.\" According to a 2007 study for the National Institute of Justice, only a small fraction (2.4%) of female undergraduate students who were sexually assaulted were certain or suspected they were incapacitated after having been given a drug without her knowledge. The Center for Women and Families notes that alcohol is the chief concern: \"For rape which takes place on campuses, alcohol is being used in 90% of cases.\" A pilot program is set to take place at a bar in Boston in either December or January. As for cost, DrinkSavvy says prices will be competitive with what the bars already pay for cups and straws.",

        "article": "It is a tradition going back 150 years, with hardened swimmers jumping into the sea at Brighton on a crisp Christmas Day. But Brighton and Hove City Council has decided it will close the beach on Christmas Day over 'safety fears' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago. Brighton Swimming Club agreed to follow the council's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years. Scroll down for video . Brighton and Hove City Council has banned a Christmas day swim after two previous incidents and will be closing its beaches around Palace Pier to prevent revellers taking part in the swim, as they did in 2011 . The Christmas Day swim in Brighton has seen thousands turn out to take part, like this reveller in 2010 . A spokesman for the council said: 'This year the council will be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing the beaches around the Palace Pier.' The council said it had decided to close the beach after fears over the safety of people getting into the water on Christmas day. An experienced male swimmer had to be rescued in October and a spokesman said they were concerned a similar thing could happen during the festive swim. Also in 2012 a woman died during a similar swim in Hastings and a year earlier a man had to be rescued. Seafront Manager Chris Ingall added: 'Sea swimming takes skill, stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced, using suitable wetsuits, in very calm conditions and with a friend. 'Even on a calm day sea currents, undertow or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning. 'Even experienced swimmers can get caught out.' The cancellation ends a 150 year tradition for Brighton Swimming Club. Fiona Southwell, sea swimming coach at the club, said it was a shame for club members but necessary to ensure people's safety as the event had become so large and unwieldy it was dangerous. In 2011 dozens of swimmers turned up at Brighton beach for the swim and a man had to be rescued . In 2009 a team of Santas took part in the swim, but fancy dress can make it dangerous for the inexperienced . She said there are no lifeguards on the beach on Christmas Day and it was impossible to rely on the swimming club and the RNLI to look after thousands of people who lack understanding of the tides and risks of swimming in such cold temperatures. She said:\u00a0'It's become unsafe. We have an 8C sea that people have to get into by jumping off a shelf. People are not aware of the environment and dangers. 'Hypothermia was one of the biggest problems we had and the event just became unmanageable. It went from being a club-only swim to a massive public. 'When it started there were about 30 people in our club taking part. In 2008 a Christmas day swimmer is pictured in full Santa outfit taking part in the swim in freezing waters . 'But our club basically became responsible for looking after 4,000 ridiculous people in costumes who were throwing themselves in the sea after drinking alcohol.' Ms Southwell was one of the people who rescued a man taking part in the event three years ago, who had been drinking heavily the night before and had come in fancy dress - which can often restrict swimmers once they are in the water. She added: 'The biggest turnout we ever had was when we nearly lost a member of the public. I and three other club members had to go in and save this man. That was really the end of the line. 'We fully support the council. We are sad that we've had to stop a 150 year tradition but we fully support this for health and safety reasons.' Last year as the south of Britain was battered by heavy rain and storms Brighton and Hove Council also closed the Palace Pier in a bid to stop people venturing into the sea. Members of Brighton Swimming Club, pictured in 2002, will not be able to take part in the swim after the club cancelled the event because it has become dangerous with too many inexperienced people turning up . Brighton Swimming Club said people have been turning up without knowledge of the dangers of swimming in cold waters and often after a heavy night's drinking, putting themselves in danger once they get in the sea . Ms Southwell added: 'We supported this action by the council. What we do is pretty extreme and specialised. We can't be seen as a bad example and encouraging the normal public to think it's ok to do what we do.' She said it was especially dangerous at Brighton because the pier is shelved - meaning people have to drive straight into the freezing waters to take part. At beaches like in Exmouth, where the Christmas Day swim is still due to take place this year, the risks are much lower as people are able to walk into the sea from the wide beach. Last year dozens of swimmers braved the cold to swim in the Serpentine in London for the Peter Pan Cup . Serpentine Swimming Club said the popular Christmas Day swim would be going ahead as planned this year . Serpentine swimming club, based in London, is also going ahead with an annual Christmas Day swim this year. It will be the 150th anniversary of the event, which begins at 9am as swimmers compete for the Peter Pan Cup. Author J M Barrie became associated with the Christmas Day race in 1903 and donated the first cup for the winner. The traditional Saundersfoot swim, this year with a World War One theme, will also take place on New Year's Day in Wales.",

        "article": "JetBlue have been fiercely criticised after Tweeting an ill-advised pun referencing the Hindenburg disaster. To its 1.9 million followers on Twitter, the no-frills US airline wrote 'Oh, the Bluemanity' as it showed of the designs on its aircraft tail. The phrase was a take on when radio announcer Herbert Morrison exclaimed 'Oh, the humanity!' in 1937 when he reported on the terrible disaster that left 36 people dead. Although the ill-advised Tweet was removed within minutes, people had already re-Tweeted the item . JetBlue have come in for fierce criticism after referencing the Hindenburg disaster on Twitter . Almost immediately after the poorly thought-out Tweet went live, users rounded on the company expressing their shock at the reference. Twitter user Joey White was quick to point out that while JetBlue were quick to delete, the internet 'never forgets' while most described the Tweet as 'the ultimate faux pas.' The Tweet was deleted before 10 minutes had passed, but the seed had been sown. JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston told the Daily News: 'We recognized it was an error. It was not well thought out, and we removed it.' The company then proceeded to reply back to users who had seriously questioned the logic of posting such a message. A total of 36 people died when the Hindenburg airship burst into flames in New Jersey, US . Replying to a shocked Jake Hamilton, JetBlue wrote: 'We got caught up in our own cleverness and didn't think it all the way through.' The Hindenburg disaster took place on May 6, 1937, as the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, US. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), there were 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen). One worker on the ground was also killed, making a total of 36 dead. The disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. The accident, at the time, was considered to be the worst in commercial aviation history. MailOnline Travel have contacted JetBlue and are awaiting comment.",

When Lesley Mair leapt out of her car to help a collapsed woman, most bystanders saw her as a Good Samaritan. But it appears that Edinburgh\u2019s notorious parking attendants saw her as nothing more than an errant motorist, and gave her a ticket for leaving her vehicle in a disabled bay. Miss Mair, 43, abandoned her car in the city\u2019s Portobello High Street as she rushed to the aid of a young woman sprawled face down on the pavement. Annoyed: Lesley Mair was given a parking ticket for leaving her vehicle in a disabled bay in Edinburgh after she leapt out of her car to help a collapsed woman . However after helping the casualty recover in a nearby bank, Miss Mair returned to her car to find she had been booked for illegal parking. The credit control manager had been driving to work at a book wholesaler in Leith, Edinburgh, when she spotted the woman \u2018out cold\u2019 and pulled over to help. She said: \u2018I thought the girl was dead at first, but after a while she regained consciousness and I think she\u2019d had a seizure or blacked out. \u2018Obviously, I panicked when I saw that and parked up quickly to\u00a0 get to her. At the same time two people arrived to help and when she came round she was a bit groggy and dazed. \u2018She was complaining of stomach pains, so we took her into the Bank of Scotland to keep her warm and called an ambulance. \u2018It was while we were in there I noticed I was getting a parking ticket \u2013 it had been a matter of moments. \u2018My only concern was for the lady on the street, I wasn\u2019t looking where I was parking.\u2019 Harsh: Despite her kind actions, it appears that Edinburgh's notorious parking attendants saw Miss Mair as nothing more than an errant motorist . Bosses at NSL, which manages the city\u2019s parking attendants, said they were \u2018entirely satisfied\u2019 that their attendant acted in a \u2018sympathetic and professional way\u2019. But Miss Mair, from Musselburgh, East Lothian, branded her treatment as \u2018yet another example of an over-zealous parking attendant\u2019 who was \u2018chasing commission\u2019. She said: \u2018The parking attendant must have looked over and seen the commotion going on. \u2018I am utterly appalled by the lack of consideration given by this man who, when I told him the situation, just shrugged his shoulders and turned his back on me.\u2019 It is understood the ill woman was taken to hospital by paramedics. Her condition is not known. Onlookers said that they were astonished as they watched the parking attendant move in on the car. A shopworker who had a clear view of the incident said: \u2018We saw the woman being helped by some people and then being taken into the bank. \u2018Next thing there was a parking attendant looking at the cars and he started writing a ticket. It\u2019s unbelievable he could do that.\u2019 Councillor Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh\u2019s transport convener, said: \u2018If Miss Mair was assisting with a medical emergency, we will of course cancel the ticket when she raises it with us. \u2018We will also take her comments regarding the conduct of the parking attendant seriously and will investigate the matter with NSL.\u2019",

Victim: Former McDonald's employee Louise Ogborn was made to strip naked and perform star jumps in front of her boss on the orders of a hoaxer pretending to be a police officer on the phone . The surreal true story of a McDonald's employee stripped naked by her boss who had fallen victim to an elaborate hoax is the subject of a new film. McDonald's staff member Louise Ogborn, 18, had been working at the Mount Washington branch in Kentucky, America, for four months when she was falsely accused of stealing a customer's purse in 2004. Her boss, assistant manager Donna Summers had received a phone call from a man pretending to be a police officer and, on his instruction, subjected her employee to a three-hour ordeal where she was stripped naked, abused and humiliated. It was only when another employee demanded McDonald's head-office be contacted that staff realised they had been duped by a phone hoaxer who is believed to have targeted managers of more than 70 fast food outlets across America. The bizarre episode is the basis for new movie Compliance, starring Dreama Walker, which opened yesterday. It all started when Summers received a phone call from a man claiming to be a police officer who told her that Ms Ogborn was a 'thief' who needed to be held until officers arrived at the scene. On the officer's instructions, Summers called Ms Ogborn into the office, took her car keys and phone and locked the door. The fake police officer then told Summers she must make the teenager strip naked and put her clothes in a bag to preserve evidence. Incredibly, the assistant manager did as she was told, believing the caller to be a genuine policeman. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Donna Summers, left, was sacked by McDonald's and given a year's probation while her former fiance Walter Nix, right, was jailed fro five years for sexually abusing Ms Ogborn . CCTV footage: Louise Ogborn, then 18, had been working for McDonald's for four months when she was called in to the office at the Mount Washington branch in Kentucky and accused of stealing . Phone hoax: Ms Ogborn's boss Donna Summers then told her to strip naked on the orders of 'Officer Scott' speaking on the telephone . Summers made Ms Ogborn dance naked with her hands above her head, perform jumping jacks and deep knee bends. On the instruction of Officer Scott', she then got her fianc\u00e9 Walter Nix, 42, to continue the 'punishment', forcing Ms Ogborn to sit on his lap, have her buttocks slapped and finally to perform a sex act on him. Another manager and two employees saw the abuse happening but did nothing as they believed it was being conducted on police orders. It was only when 58-year-old maintenance worker Thomas Simms refused to take over the abuse and demanded an area manager be contacted the episode ended. Helpless: Ms Ogborn can be seen wiping her eyes as Summers continues to take orders from over the phone . Trapped: Summers also took Ms Ogborn's car keys and mobile phone so she had no way escaping or calling for help . Summers claimed the caller sounded so convincing she was happy to do whatever he said. She continued: 'When I asked him why he always had an answer. I honestly thought he was a police officer.' She said she begged Ms Ogborn for forgiveness as soon as she realised her mistake and called of her engagement to Nix after viewing CCTV of what he had done. The pair were taken to court and Nix was jailed for five years for sexual abuse while Summers was sacked and got a year's probation for false imprisonment. Ms Ogborn sued McDonald's for \u00a3127million but later accepted \u00a3700,000 out of court. Ms Ogborn said she did what she was told because she was terrified of losing her \u00a34.20-an-hour job but claimed she did beg her managed to let her go, the Daily Mirror reports. Bizarre: A man can be seen in the office appearing to hold Ms Ogborn while Summers can be seen sitting down on the other side . Abuse: Ms Ogborn can be seen to dance around naked in front of man as he talks on the phone to the hoax caller pretending to be a policeman . She said: 'My parents taught me when an adult tells you to do something that's what you do. You don't argue, you listen. 'Every time Donna came in the room I begged \"Get me out of here. I didn't do anything\". I was bawling my eyes out and begging them to take me to the police station.' It was not the first time a hoax caller has managed to convince fast food managers to abuse their staff by pretending to be a police officer. A similar episode occurred at a Missouri drive-in just a month earlier. In total, seven people have been jailed for performing strip searches on members of staff after falling prey to hoax callers. Father-of-five David Stewart was accused of being being the series of calls but was acquitted in 2006 of impersonating a police officer, solicitation to commit sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment because of lack of evidence. Duped: The entire episode lasted nearly three hours before another employee demanded an area manager be called when they were asked to take over the 'punishment' In court: Louise Ogborn sued McDonald's for \u00a3127million but later accepted \u00a3700,000 out of court .

High-flying: Choudhuri worked on the world-renowned Harley Street in Westminster, London (pictured) and claimed to treat Hollywood stars and foreign royalty . They didn\u2019t have Choudhuri\u2019s name but he was recognised by staff member Lisa Wright a month later when he returned to the branch, the court heard. Police arrived and arrested Choudhuri, who claimed to know a superintendent in the force and told the officers they would \u2018lose their jobs\u2019. When he was searched a 1,000 dollar Singapore note was found in the wallet he was carrying. Miss Wright, a witness in the trial, later received a call from Choudhuri or a man acting on his behalf claiming to be from the \u2018witness protection scheme\u2019 to inform her that the trial was cancelled. It was a ruse to stop the witness going to court to give evidence against him, the jury heard. The doctor also tried to set up a false alibi by pressuring his accountant into saying they had a meeting in the afternoon when in fact it took place in the morning. Choudhuri claimed that clients in his private medical practice included royalty from the Middle East, Hollywood stars and rich footballers\u2019 wives. He said he believed the wallet in Starbucks was his as he routinely carried many with him. One on the day in question in October 2010 he claimed to have had 20 wallets in a \u2018man bag\u2019. Scene: The wallet went missing from the coffee shop in Nottingham city centre in October 2010 (file picture) Choudhuri said he was carrying the Singapore banknote when arrested because wealthy international clients often paid him in currency from their own countries. Asked by his barrister, David Dein, if he had ever broken the law, Choudhuri replied: \u2018I\u2019ve always made it my mantra to respect the police and stay out of trouble.\u2019 However, the court was told after his arrest, he sent a text message to his wife that read: \u2018If pigs ask you anything, it is always no comment. Don\u2019t tell them anything.\u2019 Choudhuri was also ordered to pay \u00a323,395 prosecution costs and \u00a34,000 compensation to the tourist. Mr Dein said taking the wallet was a \u2018moment of inexplicable madness\u2019. He added that Choudhuri\u2019s career as a doctor was now over as it was \u2018almost certain\u2019 he would be struck off by the General Medical Council. Choudhuri, who was the only pupil from his comprehensive to go to university, ran a business called Body Perfect with his wife, Dr Fatima Jabbar. It has clinics in London, Nottingham, Beverly Hills and Monaco. Taken: The wallet taken by Dr Choudhuri contained a 1000 Singapore dollar note . Clinic: Body Perfect, ran by Dr Choudhuri, claimed it was the 'UK's Leading Doctor Led Comestic Clinic'",

        "article": "Abu Wa'el Dhiab, pictured, claims the process of force feeding him is abusive . The White House wants a court hearing into a Guantanamo Bay prisoner held without trial since August 2002 held in secret. Abu Wa'el Dhiab, from Syria, has been on hunger strike and claims that attempts by medics to force feed him are abusive. However, the Obama administration claims that much of the information about Dhiab is highly classified and cannot be discussed in open court. The Justice Department claims that 'an open hearing risks unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected information. The record in this case is large, with classified and protected information often inextricably intertwined with unclassified information'. Dhiab's legal team claims that their client has to be forcibly removed from his cell by guards, and strapped to a chair where the force feeding is carried out. The Defense Department counters that they only force feed patients against their will to keep them alive. The hearing is due to take place on October 6 where three doctors will give evidence about the mental and physical impact of force feeding. Dhaib's lawyer Jon Eisenberg said they will present 32 video tapes showing the force feeding process. Eisenberg said: 'This hearing is going to be much like a full-blown trial. What the government is seeking to do is to keep all of it secret.' The Justice Department said that any unclassified materiel would be released and a public version of the case transcripts would be published. The former Navy commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Admiral Richard Butler, said in a court declaration filed in July that even though the forced cell extraction videos are lawful, humane and appropriate, they 'are particularly susceptible to use as propaganda and to incite a public reaction because of their depiction of forcible ... guard interaction with detainees.' The videos that also contain footage of forced-feedings could be used 'to foment anti-American sentiment and inflame Muslim sensitivities as it depicts ... personnel providing medical care to a detainee while he is restrained,' Butler said in the declaration. Human rights activists have campaigned for the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, pictured . The prison is based in Guantanamo Naval Station in Cuba, pictured, was opened in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks . Releasing a video showing a detainee receiving medical care while restrained 'would exacerbate the world's perception of detainees in U.S. custody,' Butler added. 'Public release, in whole or in part, of videos showing forced cell extractions' or feedings would cause 'serious damage to national security'. Dhiab, 42, was categorised as being suitable for release and resettlement in 2009 and has not been charged with any offence. Hunger strikes at Guantanamo began shortly after the prison opened in 2002, with force-feeding starting in early 2006 following a mass hunger strike. A new strike began in February 2013, with more than 100 of 154 prisoners in custody participating at one point. There are currently 149 prisoners at the detention center, and Crider has said the legal team believes roughly 34 are on hunger strike and some 18 meet the guidelines for feedings. Dhiab started his hunger strike 18 months ago as a protest against his indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay. Medical staff at Guantanamo Bay use this nasal tube to force feed Dhiab when he refuses to eat . In July, the Pentagon agreed to transfer Dhiab and five other prisoners to Uruguay, which has agreed to give them asylum. The men are unable to return to their own homes because of the threat to their lives. Dhiab was arrested in Pakistan, where he claims he was a honey salesman. His legal team said he has been forcibly extracted from his cell almost 50 times this year. However, camp officials claim that Dhiab has been abusive to guards, threatening to kill or seriously injure them. He said since April he has tried to assault troops three times and twice used vomit and faeces as weapons.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- In a move to squash dissent within North Korea's ruling elite, the once-powerful uncle of Leader Kim Jong Un was removed from his government position at a Ruling Workers' Party politburo meeting Sunday, North Korea's state news agency KCNA confirmed. Jang Song Thaek, who married Kim's aunt, was the vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and has often been pictured beside Kim, who has ruled North Korea since his father's death in 2011. \"Some see this as perhaps the last part of the power consolidation phase, that Kim Jong Un has in fact removed all of the old guard close to his father and is now finalizing the inserting of his own inner group,\" said John Park, a Northeast Asia analyst at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Jang and his allies were accused by Kim of double-dealing behind the scene, \"dreaming different dreams\" and selling off the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to the KCNA statement. Opinion: North Korea's young Kim there to stay . \"Jang desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side,\" the statement said. The public document also scolds Jang for improper relations with several women, drug use, gambling, eating at expensive restaurants and getting medical treatment in a foreign country. Last week two close allies of Jang -- Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-kee -- were publicly executed, South Korean lawmakers said at a news conference. The lawmakers, including Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party, said this after receiving what they said was a briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. North Korea, a state shrouded in secrecy, is involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and Western powers over its nuclear weapons program. Tensions between North and South Korea soared this year as Pyongyang reacted angrily to tightened United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test. The two sides are still technically at war after the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, ended in a truce, not a treaty. Opinion: World must awaken to North Korea's camps of horror .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Hours after a North Carolina police chief issued a tearful plea for help in locating a registered sex offender suspected in the death of his 23-year-old daughter, the man was arrested in upstate New York, authorities said Monday. Michael Neal Harvey, 34, was arrested without incident by FBI agents and U.S. marshals in Niagara Falls, New York, on Monday morning in connection with the death of Valerie Hamilton, according to a statement issued by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, police. Detectives from Charlotte were on the way to New York to interview Harvey and \"work on the extradition process,\" the statement said. Harvey was located inside a house in Niagara Falls, said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe. The town was one of the places authorities thought he might flee, because he has relatives there, Monroe said. Warrants for Harvey were issued on murder and auto theft charges, police said. A stolen 1996 Chevy Blazer that police had said Harvey was last seen driving also was recovered in Niagara Falls, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. Authorities earlier had issued a description of the vehicle. Earlier Monday, Hamilton's father, Merl Hamilton, the chief of police of Concord, North Carolina, about 30 miles northeast of Charlotte, issued a tearful plea on \"Good Morning America\" for help locating the suspect. \"I just want to get this guy now,\" he said. Valerie Hamilton, who lived in Charlotte, was last seen between 12:30 and 1:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Thomas Street Tavern in Charlotte with a man believed to be Harvey. Her friends and family became concerned when she failed to show up at the Little Otter Swim School, where she worked as a children's swim coach, according to CNN affiliate WSOC. \"It's not like her not to show up and let us know,\" her boss, John Kirk, told the station. He described Valerie Hamilton as \"one of those bright, shining people that a kid can't cry around.\" After several days of searching, Valerie Hamilton's body was found in a Charlotte storage unit late Saturday. Monroe said repeated witness interviews and \"very aggressive investigation\" led authorities to the storage unit. He said the cause and manner of death was not immediately known, but an autopsy was being conducted Monday. When the body was found, it was wrapped, he said, and authorities avoided disturbing it as much as possible, he said. The cause and manner of Valerie Hamilton's death, when determined, could result in additional charges being filed or the modification of existing charges, he said. Investigators are focusing on several areas, including a hotel where media reports said Harvey was thought to have stayed and the storage unit where the body was found. Authorities are not sure whether Valerie Hamilton was abducted or left the tavern willingly with Harvey, Monroe said. \"Just trying to rehash Miss Hamilton's steps ... led us to Mr. Harvey,\" he said. Authorities believe Valerie Hamilton was killed shortly after she was last seen, and her body had been in the storage unit for a couple of days, Monroe said. When a reporter from CNN affiliate WVIB in Buffalo, New York, approached Harvey's relatives over the weekend, they refused to go on camera. \"He hasn't been here in six years,\" an unidentified man told the station. \"Leave. That's my comment.\" Monroe said authorities had not found a connection between Harvey's relatives and the house where he was located. \"I want to ask my law enforcement brothers and sisters across the country to help me with this,\" Merl Hamilton said Monday on ABC. \"I'm trying to stay strong, and they know what it means because the cameras are on -- but he took my daughter, guys. And play it right, play by the rules, but y'all get out there and find this guy for me, and when it comes my way, I'll pay you back.\" Harvey is a registered sex offender with a 1996 first-degree sex offense conviction out of New York, according to the state sex offender registry website. WIVB and the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported he had served time in prison. He also has a lengthy police record in North Carolina, including drug and weapons charges, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police spokeswoman Officer Rosalyn Harrington said. Monroe said police had gotten word that Harvey knew he was wanted. \"I don't think it came as any real surprise to him that authorities were able to locate him,\" he said. Neighbors of Harvey's family described their Niagara Falls neighborhood as a quiet one, where families remain for a number of years, WIVB said. Concord is \"a very close-knit community,\" Mayor Scott Padgett said on \"Good Morning America.\" He said there had been a \"tremendous outpouring\" of support for the chief and his family. Hamilton told ABC young women should remember the safety lessons they have been taught. \"It carries into when you're in your 20s,\" he said. \"... Make sure these men treat you with respect, and be safe.\" Asked to describe his daughter, the chief said, \"She was a good kid. She was a wonderful kid. She lived her life to take care of children. That's all she wanted to do. She was the perfect daughter, and I miss her, and I need justice for her and I need folks to be looking for this guy.\" CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.",

        "article": "By . Sara Malm . Pet owners in Thailand are being told to keep a close eye on their four-legged friends after hundreds of dog remains were found near the border of Laos. It is thought the dog remains, made up of hundreds of skins and bones which had been abandoned in a forest in Sakon Nakhon, northeastern Thailand, were destined for Vietnam and China. There, dog meat is considered a delicacy, but is also used to make leather products \u2013 in particular golf gloves made from canine testicles. In danger: Smugglers kidnap pet dogs as they are easier to catch than strays, and sell the skin to leather manufacturers in China and Vietnam . The find was made last month by Thai police, who revealed the purpose of the practice, which is illegal in Thailand. \u2018The skins would be bleached - some are then sent (by smugglers) to other countries to be made into gloves for playing golf,\u2019 Lamai Sakolpitak, from a special police unit to suppress smuggling and the trade in animal parts, told AFP. 'Extra soft': The skin from dogs' testicles are used to make golfing gloves . 'Experts say that dog skins are also used for instruments such as drums.\u2019 Mr . Lamai said the find is linked to the March raids on two makeshift . factories in the area where smugglers would strip skin from dogs and . preserve the meat. Dog skin is highly sought after by manufacturers of golf gloves, predominantly the skin from the testicles as it is particularly soft, John Dalley, co-founder and vice-president of Thai dog welfare organisation Soi Dog Foundation, told Businessweek.com. Although there are thousands of stray dogs in Thailand\u2019s many large cities, smugglers prefer domestic pets as they are easier to catch, Mr Dalley says. \u2018Stray dogs are extremely difficult to catch. It\u2019s far easier to catch pet dogs or unwanted service dogs,\u2019 he says, adding that the illegal dog trade is extremely cruel. Mr Dalley, who has lived in Thailand for over a decade, says dogs are often packed into cages before being dragged out and skinned alive. Local campaign group Watchdog Thailand confirmed that dog skin is used for golf gloves, hats and wallets and that smugglers will offer to pay around $10 for a live dog, including pets and strays. Brutal: It is illegal to kill dogs for meat in Thailand, but many take the risk to make money off the lucrative market in China .",

The policy of cultural assimilation of Native Americans spanned roughly from the 1800s midway into the 20th century as a way to \"Americanize\" indigenous people through forced English education, sending children away to boarding schools and banning tribal religious traditions.

Then on Valentine's Day, a neighbor confronted Rice demanding to know why he had sent a card to his wife. Eight other wives in the neighborhood also received similar cards. But most shocking was when Rice typed his wife's name into an internet search engine and discovered that there were ads inviting men to their home for a 'Carmel Valley Freak Show'.

The prosecutor said the charges were filed because Rowe's actions went far beyond a prank. In December, Rowe entered a plea bargain over the stalking charges, in exchange for prosecutors to drop felony charges of soliciting rape and sodomy and misdemeanor charges of identity theft and harassment. Conviction of soliciting rape would have required Rowe to register for life as a sex offender. In court on Friday, Rowe apologized to the couple for what she had put them through. 'I just wanted to say how humiliated I am by my behavior \u2013 that this is not representative of who I am. I've never behaved like this \u2013 never will again,' she said,\u00a0Fox5 reported. She said she acted due to the stress she was under and never intended to cause the couple any harm - but in court, the couple said they felt terrorized. 'Dream home': Rowe, who had been named as one of the city's top moms in 2007, said it was devastating when she lost the home, pictured due to a miscommunication with real estate agents in 2011 . Luxury: She said that the home had been perfect for her the family in part because it had a swimming pool (pictured), to provide exercise for her husband following a heart attack . Inside: She repeatedly encouraged strange men to go to the home, pictured, to have sex with Ruhter . 'The home should be a place of safety and sanctuary,' Ruhter said. 'But I never truly felt this way in our house. I felt most secure away from my home. The house became my prison.' Rice added: 'Had law enforcement not intervened in this case, I am certain Mrs. Rowe would have continued her attacks until she successfully brought physical harm to a member of my family.' In a letter to a judge last year, Rowe explained it had been 'devastating' when she lost the house due to mis-communication with real estate agents, and a more attractive bid from the other couple. She had her heart set on the home because it was a single story, to accommodate her severely disabled daughter, and had a pool, to provide exercise for her husband following a heart attack. 'The anger and grief over losing that house (and especially in the way we did) drove me to behave in a very childish way and to do what I thought were childish pranks to let off steam and ease the pain,' Rowe said. 'I never intended for them to be hurtful.'",

Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi, 20, who fled the UK for the Middle East nine months ago,  has 'no sympathy' for the executed man and said  'people love to see heads on spikes'. The Muslim convert is among the hundreds of people who have fled to UK to fight in ISIS and says 'there is no going back'. Posed up: British ISIS fighter\u00a0Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi, 20, poses in front of a Syrian soldier strung up and decapitated in Syria . Up to 500 British Muslims are believed to be in the region with as many as half joining forces with ISIS, a group known for its extreme violence, including crucifying and beheading its enemies. Justifying the gruesome photo the British citizen originally from Eritrea told\u00a0BBC's Newsnight: 'People love to see heads on spikes. I feel no sympathy for them because they are all enemies of Allah. 'Isis treats its enemies in the same way they treat us'. According to the BBC he has been based in the in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold - where many other Britons, including the female 'Terror Twins' from Manchester. Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, ran away from their family in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago for 'paradise' in the war torn Middle East. It has also become renowned for the brutal executions, and crucifixions, of ISIS' enemies. Photographs posted on social media of Al-Habashi clutching a machine gun appear to show him across the border in Ramadi, Iraq, where he says he has been on the front line. He said: 'It is the best fighting and the hardest. You are in a city of concrete and everything is blowing up'. Al-Habashi says his family know where he is and have told him: 'Come back - you are crazy'. He has told them: 'This is for the sake of Allah. I'm free. Why would I come back to (go to) prison?'. Face of ISIS: Al-Habashi appeared on a video this weekend where he criticised democracy and demanded Sharia law . Propaganda: In the video a child is shown holding a machine gun with a caption about 'peace and security' Message: The video promoting ISIS and its Caliphate was timed to coincide with Eid . The Muslim convert has \u00a0also urged others from the UK to fight in the Middle East and has the become the face of ISIS in its latest recruitment video. Over the weekend a new film was released where he described how wonderful it was to live in the new Islamic Caliphate stretching across Syria and northern Iraq. It features fighters from the UK, Finland and America. He says in a strong British accent: 'You're not living under oppression. You're not living under rule. 'As Muslims, that's what we want and that's what we need. We don't need any democracy, we don't need any communism, we don't need anything like that.'

        "article": "A Darwin man discovered a huge sinkhole which had opened up just metres from his home late last week after he heard the sound of the earth collapsing in on itself. Darwin River resident Lance Hart told Nine News he was alerted to the hole when he heard a 'rumbling kind of like distant thunder'. 'Can't be thunder, it's dry season,' Mr Hart said, before he revealed that when he ventured out into his backyard a few days later he realised something was wrong when he came across a large crack in the earth. Scroll down for video . Darwin river man Lance Hart was amazed when he discovered a gaping sinkhole just metres from his home . Though it's not the first of its kind in the area, this sinkhole is the biggest locals have ever seen. Mr Hart likened it to the famous scene from Crocodile Dundee where Paul Hogan's character bragged, 'that's not a knife, this is a knife', and laughed that he now had the biggest sinkhole. In a video posted to YouTube Mr Hart walked less than 50 metres from the back of his home and stood at edge of the gaping hole, which swallowed trees and boulders. Mr Hart told Nine News he watched enourmous boulders swallowed by the water at the bottom of the hole . His footage shows the sheer size of the sinkhole, estimated to be 40 metres wide and drop down 15 metres to the point where it's filled with water. 'That, is a big hole,' Mr Hart narrated. 'I have no idea how deep that water is, but from the rocks that are still falling in to it... We're seeing massive boulders slide down and disappear underneath the surface so it's obviously very deep,' he continued. Trees as tall as 20 metres which once stood tall where the hole now lies are nowhere to be seen, and experts are unsure whether the gap will continue to expand. Before he reached the hole, Mr Hart found a long fissure in the earth . The sinkhole absorbed everything around it and experts are unsure whether it will continue to expand . Neighbour Daniel Cocks told the program he was extremely grateful the gap didn't appear on his property, where he keeps his collection of 24 old Land Rovers. 'They're 30, 40 year old Land Rovers, I've got 24 of them... I don't really want to lose them, not in a great big hole,' Mr Cocks laughed. At the end of the YouTube video, Mr Hart summed up his new backyard feature in one word: 'Amazing.'",

        "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The disabled young son of UK opposition leader David Cameron has died. David Cameron leaves the family home after the death of his 6-year-old son on February 25. Ivan Cameron, six, passed away early Wednesday, the UK's Press Association reported a Conservative Party spokesman as saying.  \"It is with great sadness that David and Samantha Cameron must confirm the death of their six-year-old son Ivan,\" the spokesman said according to the agency.  The spokesman said that Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy, was taken ill overnight and died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, central London early Wednesday morning.  \"David and Samantha would ask that their privacy is respected at this terribly difficult time,\" the spokesman added. Meanwhile, the queen sent a private message of sympathy to the Camerons, Buckingham Palace said. Prime minister Gordon Brown said the \"thoughts and prayers of the whole country\" would be with the Conservative leader and his family, The Guardian newspaper reported, while prime minister's question time -- which offers Cameron a weekly opportunity to grill Brown in parliament -- was cancelled at Brown's suggestion. The prime minister, together with other senior British politicians, instead offered their condolences in the parliament chamber. \"I know that the whole house will want to express their sorrow at the death of Ivan Cameron,\" Brown told lawmakers, according to The Guardian. \"He brought joy to all those around him.

        "article": "By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A bid to win favour at a  strip club went disastrously wrong for a man who claimed he was Spike Lee's son - when staff realised the boy in question is only 17. Despite wielding a fabled American Express black card, the mystery partier was reportedly thrown out of the New York venue as soon as curious bouncers looked up the teenager on Google. According to the report in the New York Post, the spurned clubber shouted: 'I\u2019m not going to be arrested. No one\u2019s going to arrest me!', before racing to a waiting car. Bold: A man reportedly claimed he was Jackson Lee (right), the son of Hollywood director Spike (left), to get into a strip club - but he was busted when staff looked Jackson up on Google and realised he is only 17 . Hollywood legend Spike Lee, 57, whose directing credits include Malcolm X (1992) and He Got Game (1998), has two children with his wife of more than 20 years Tonya Lewis Lee. His daughter Satchel was born in 1994 while his son Jackson was born in 1997, putting both well under the legal drinking age of 21. A source told the newspaper the party-goer dropped Jackson's name when he arrived at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in the early hours last week, and showed an ID which said he was 22 years old. Then, the report claimed, he placed the $60 entry fee on an American Express Centurion card, better known as the invitation-only 'black card' whose users earn an average of $1.3million. Its users must spend at least $250,000 a year - and even then it'll cost them an annual fee of $2,500 along with a $7,500 initiation fee. But Jackson's mother told the Post the man at the club was not her son, adding any suggestion that he was would be a 'bald-faced lie'. What a hustler: The man flashed an American Express Centurion card at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in New York . It would not be the first time a fake celebrity has caused a stir in New York City. Two years ago 21-year-old student Brett Cohen hired fake bodyguards, paparazzi and an entourage to follow him around the streets of Manhattan in a bid to fool people into thinking he was famous. It worked - and he caused a crush of 300 people while posing for photographs with groups of giggling girls. He later said it was a\u00a0'social experiment,' which showed 'how our culture is so obsessed with celebrity and fame'. Widely hailed as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation, Spike Lee has devoted his film career to tales of urban poverty, inequality and race relations. He has twice been nominated for an Oscar, the first for Do the Right Thing (1989) and the second for 4 Little Girls (1997).",

        "article": "By . Associated Press . The Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa is 'totally out of control' and doctors are stretched to the limit in their attempts to respond to the disease, a senior medic said today. The current outbreak has caused more deaths than any other on record, said an official from the Doctors without Boarders charity. Ebola has been linked to more than 330 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization. International organizations and the governments involved need to send in more health experts and increase public education messages about how to stop the spread of the disease, Bart Janssens, the director of operations for the group in Brussels, said on Friday. Scroll down for video . People protest outside a hospital as Liberia President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  visits the area as reports suggest hundreds have died from Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia. Senior medics have called for more health experts to be flown in and for public safety messages to be increased . 'The reality is clear that the epidemic is now in a second wave,' Janssens said. 'And, for me, it is totally out of control.' The outbreak, which began in Guinea either late last year or early this year, had appeared to slow before picking up pace again in recent weeks, including spreading to the Liberian capital for the first time. 'This is the highest outbreak on record and has the highest number of deaths, so this is unprecedented so far,' said Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders. According to a World Health Organization list, the highest previous death toll was in the first recorded Ebola outbreak in Congo in 1976, when 280 deaths were reported. Because Ebola often touches remote areas and the first cases sometimes go unrecognized, it is likely that there are deaths that go uncounted, both in this outbreak and previous ones. The multiple locations of the current outbreak and its movement across borders make it one of the 'most challenging Ebola outbreaks ever,' Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said earlier in the week. The outbreak shows no sign of abating and that governments and international organizations were 'far from winning this battle,' Unni Krishnan, head of disaster preparedness and response for Plan International, said Friday. A Liberian nurse at the Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia where a nurse reportedly died of Ebola virus . But Janssens' description of the Ebola outbreak was even more alarming, and he warned that the governments affected had not recognized the gravity of the situation. He criticized the World Health Organization for not doing enough to prod leaders and said that it needs to bring in more experts to do the vital work of tracing all of the people who have been in contact with the sick. 'There needs to be a real political commitment that this is a very big emergency,' he said. 'Otherwise, it will continue to spread, and for sure it will spread to more countries.' The World Health Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy minister of health, said that people in the highest levels of government are working to contain the outbreak as proved by the fact that that Liberia had a long period with no new cases before this second wave. The governments involved and international agencies are definitely struggling to keep up with the severity of the outbreak, said Krishnan of Plan, which is providing equipment to the three affected countries and spreading information about how people can protect themselves against the disease. But he noted that the disease is striking in one of the world's poorest regions, where public health systems are already fragile. 'The affected countries are at the bottom of the human development index,' he said in an emailed statement. 'Ebola is seriously crippling their capacities to respond effectively in containing the spread.' The situation requires a more effective response, said Janssens of Doctors Without Borders. With more than 40 international staff currently on the ground and four treatment centers, Doctors Without Borders has reached its limit to respond, he said. Empty hospital beds at the hospital after nurses and patients fled the hospital due to a number of deaths. 330 lives have been claimed following the outbreak . 'It's the first time in an Ebola epidemic where (Doctors Without Borders) teams cannot cover all the needs, at least for treatment centers,' he said. It is unclear, for instance, if the group will be able to set up a treatment center in Liberia, like the ones it is running in in Guinea and Sierra Leone, he said. For one thing, Janssens said, the group doesn't have any more experienced people in its network to call on. As it is, some of its people have already done three tours on the ground. Janssens said this outbreak is particularly challenging because it began in an area where people are very mobile and has spread to even more densely populated areas, like the capitals of Guinea and Liberia. The disease typically strikes sparsely populated areas in central or eastern Africa, where it spreads less easily, he said. By contrast, the epicenter of this outbreak is near a major regional transport hub, the Guinean city of Gueckedou. He said the only way to stop the disease's spread is to persuade people to come forward when symptoms occur and to avoid touching the sick and dead. 'There is still not a real change of behavior of the people,' he said. 'So a lot of sick people still remain in hiding or continue to travel. And there is still news that burial practices are remaining dangerous.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Here is the happy ending: a windfall of \u00a3250,000 from the Football Association and a couple of hours on prime-time BBC as reward for those responsible for keeping the club alive when fate conspired against them.

        "article": "By . James White . UPDATED: . 06:48 EST, 13 February 2012 . The U.S. Ambassador to Syria has blamed the country's government for attacks on civilians and has taken the unusual step of posting a military aerial photograph on Facebook to back his claims. Robert Ford spoke angrily about the killings of unarmed civilians in Syria's third-largest city of Homs after uploading the detailed aerial image showing army vehicles in residential neighbourhoods. Speaking from Paris after he closed the U.S. Embassy in Damascus earlier this week, he called on the country's Government to end the bombardment of civilians. The U.S. State Department also piled on the pressure by releasing further images showing the Syrian regime's artillery deployed around the country. More than 300 civilians have died in Homs in the past week alone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford posted this de-classified U.S. military image of Homs apparently showing the attacks on civilians . Military operation: Another map published on the U.S. Embassy in Damascus's website, showing artillery positions in Syria . He said: 'I've spent a good part of the day . looking at what's happening in Syria and the shelling again by Syrian . forces on residential areas of Syria's third-largest city of Homs is . absolutely awful, it's horrific. 'We want that government violence to stop before Syria goes off a cliff,' he told NBC. Speaking about his Facebook posts, he said: 'The Syrian government's claims that terrorists are shelling parts of Homs are completely ridiculous. We know who is shelling Homs. 'We know that and I do not want the Syrian government selling a propaganda scheme to try to hide the truth.' On the attack: This image - thought to be taken by a drone aircraft shows three Syrian military tanks near the Al Baath University housing complex in Homs . First, like people around the world, my . colleagues and friends are watching the video coming out of Homs and . some of the other Syrian cities in the last days with horror and . revulsion. I hear the devastating stories about newborns in Homs dying . in hospitals where electricity has been cut and when we see disturbing . photos offering proof that the regime is using mortars and artillery . against residential neighborhoods, all of us become even more concerned . about the tragic outcome for Syrian civilians. The Arab League protocol, . which received wide support from the international community, called . for the Syrian military to withdraw from residential areas, to stop . firing at peaceful protests and to release prisoners arrested due to the . unrest. The film coming out of Homs and elsewhere in Syria shows the . Syrian government's real response. And we have never heard of the armed . opposition firing artillery for example. It is odd to me that anyone . would try to equate the actions of the Syrian army and armed opposition . groups since the Syrian government consistently initiates the attacks on . civilian areas, and it is using its heaviest weapons. 'I hope they [the people of Syria] do not feel abandoned because the international community is coming together more and more. 'The government of Syria needs to respect basic human rights and it needs to allow a peaceful political transition to go forward.' On the decision to close the embassy on February 6, he said: 'Very frankly, it was very hard to take . down the American flag for the last time from the American Embassy, it . is a symbol of our presence, it is a symbol of our engagement in a . country like Syria.' Gunmen assassinated an army general in Damascus today in the first killing of a high ranking military officer in the Syrian capital since the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March. Three gunmen were reported to have opened fire at Brig. Gen. Issa al-Khouli in the morning as he left his home in the Damascus neighborhood of Rukn-Eddine. Al-Khouli was a doctor and the chief of a military hospital in the capital. No one claimed responsibility for the killing. The attack indicates that violence in Syria is reaching the tightly controlled capital, which has been relatively quiet compared to other cities. Such assassinations are not uncommon outside Damascus and army officers have been killed in the past, mostly in the restive provinces of Homs and Idlib. This morning activists claimed President\u00a0 Assad's forces killed at least four civilians in an intensified tank and rocket bombardment on opposition districts in Homs. 'This is the most violent barrage since the attack on Homs started six days ago. The four included a 55-year old woman. 'They were killed by shelling that hit a building where they live in Bab Amro,' opposition activist Mohammad Hassan said. Footage posted online showed a doctor at a field hospital in Bab Amro next to the body of the woman, who appeared to have been hit in the head. 'This is Ibtissam al-Dalati, mother of three...Shrapnel hit her in the head,' the doctor says, holding the woman's fractured and bloody head. 'I call upon all Syrians to take to the streets to take the pressure off Homs.' Pressure: The U.S. State Department has issued satellite pictures, showing Syrian artillery strategically deployed towards the city of Homes . Imagery: The images are thought to have been taken by an unmanned aircraft. This shows military hardware near Rankus last week . Western diplomat have warned Syrian officials involved in the brutal suppression of the anti-regime protests will eventually be held accountable for their actions. Efforts are under way in Western capitals to assemble evidence of human rights abuses by members of president Bashar al Assad's regime with a view to use in future proceedings. Referral to the International Criminal Court would require the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council - currently seen as unlikely given the opposition of Russia and China. However Western officials insist that eventually those Syrians responsible for atrocities against the civilian population could still be brought to book. Launch: This image released by the U.S. State Dept shows a rocket launcher near to the besieged city of Homs . Weaponry: Intelligence analysts said the images show heavy weaponry being deployed for use against civilians in or near the Syrian cities of Az Zabadani, Halbun, Rankus and Homs . Steps are already under way within . the European Union to impose travel bans and asset freezes on named . Syrian officials - a move which could translate into further action at a . later date. 'It is . important that Syrian senior regime officials understand that even if . they are out of reach today there may come a point down the line when . they will be held accountable,' said one Western diplomat. 'A . lot of these mid-ranking officials, they don't have significant assets . and within the EU jurisdiction they are probably not going to travel . much. Shelling: In this online video, tanks fire in the Baba Amro neighbourhood in the flashpoint city of Homs . Anger: Robert Ford called on Syria to stop the killing of civilians . 'But mainly it shows that a list of names that at the moment is a list of people who are not allowed to travel to the EU can very easily become another kind of list of names in another form further down the line.' Officials admit they see little hope of breaking the current cycle of violence, with the regime now apparently firmly locked in to a 'security solution'. 'With the amount of blood that has been spilt the regime is now committed to this process, it can't back up. There is too much blood spilt. It is a cul-de-sac,' said one diplomat. 'They will either succeed by force of arms or they will lose.' Bloodshed: More than 300 people including this man have died in Homs in the past week . Despite the frustration, there was caution about calls from some in the Syrian opposition for the international community to establish safe havens or humanitarian corridors through which aid can pass. Officials warned of the dangers of sending in aid workers without adequate protection. 'It is important not to engage in wishful thinking about what you can do if you are not going to do the whole thing, otherwise you end up in mid-1990s and Bosnia,' said one diplomat. Meanwhile, 28 people have been killed and 235 wounded in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, according to the country's Health Ministry. Syrian media reported that the fatalities were caused by two explosions near security compounds in the northern city yesterday. State television blamed 'terrorists' for the blasts, following the regime line that armed groups looking to destabilise Syria are behind the uprising. But opposition activists accused Mr Assad's regime of setting off the blasts. More than 5,400 people have been killed since the uprising began in March last year. Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that Britain has no plans to arm Syrian rebels trying to overthrow the president. David Cameron has pledged to maintain the pressure on Mr Assad and his government, saying he was determined to see the 'toughest possible response' to the brutality. UN chief Ban Ki-moon has condemned the 'appalling brutality' of the onslaught. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy .",

        "article": "Looted treasure: This gold-plated bronze figurine was stolen from a museum in Hama, western Syria . Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men. Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each. The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy  Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey. The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year. The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC. It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance. The primary trade routes out of Syria are through neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon, with the homes and private museums owned by wealthy Europeans the eventual destination. One 21-year-old smuggler originally from the Syrian capital Damascus but now plying his trade in Beirut says the usual method of getting the items over the border is simply to pay a taxi driver already well known to the border guards to carry it in his boot. Calling himself 'Mohammed', the smuggler says his group do their best to make money selling ancient items such as\u00a0earrings, rings, small statues and stone heads that were stolen from one of Syria's many looted museums, most of them in and around Aleppo. However his three-man outfit are positively small time compared to the large organised crime groups dealing with antiquities worth millions of pounds. These groups have the financial clout and connections to smuggle their items to Europe without arousing the suspicions of the authorities who mete out severe punishments to smugglers. Security: A Syrian police officer patrols the ancient of Palmyra to protect its ruins from looters and smugglers . Once the antiquities are outside Syria, they are generally passed on to middle men with connections to art collectors, usually in Europe of Gulf states such as Qatar or Dubai. Ahmed, a Syrian operating as a go-between in southern Turkey, claims to have recently sold a single item for $1.1 million. 'It was a piece from the year 8500BC,' he told the BBC. The middle men usually agree prices with dealers who observe the stolen items on Skype or by photographs sent online. In another sign of the organised criminal element behind the trade, the dealers then send their own teams to inspect and collect the items before the money is paid. The dealers are then able to use their contacts among wealthy art lovers to ensure the ancient items are found a new home, many of them private collections and secret museums of Europeans. Less valuable items - often still over 1,000 years old - typically find their way in to the back rooms of tourist shops in Beirut and southern Turkey, where those in the know ask to see what's on offer. Smuggling the products out of the country is the purchasers responsibility however, and the choice is between paying extortionate fees to have the items posted to an anonymous address in the West, or otherwise risk imprisonment by carrying the items on to planes and buses on their person. Making them rich: The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year . ISIS is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day, with approximately \u00a3400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil. A further \u00a3250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services and electricity production. Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds. Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged \u00a3500 per journey, plus a further \u00a3250 tax for electronic good and \u00a3200 for food parcels. However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command. For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned \u00a323 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus.",

Egypt's toppled president shouted angrily at a judge today as he appeared in court on charges of breaking out of prison in 2011. Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted by the army in July, went on trial at a makeshift courtroom in a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo. Dressed in a white prison uniform, he paced back and forth in a glass-encased metal cage, before shouting at the judge: 'Who are you? Tell me!' Scroll down for video .

Standing guard: Morsi was among 22 defendants to appear at a makeshift courtroom in a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, today. Above, armed anti-riot police officers stand guard outside the academy . The former Islamist president then told judges that he remains Egypt's legitimate leader, according to a state television reporter inside the courtroom. He also expressed anger at being in a cage, raising his hands in the . air and yelling in . apparent disbelief: 'Do you know where I am?' - to which, judge Shabaan el-Shami responded: 'I am the head of Egypt's criminal court'. Morsi was among 22 defendants to go on trial at the academy, which is situated to the east of the capital. Others include members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, such as his supreme guide, Mohamed Badie. The case is rooted in the escape of more than 20,000 inmates from . Egyptian prisons . during the early days of the 18-day uprising against  dictator Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Morsi and other Brotherhood leaders escaped two days after they were detained . three years ago as Mubarak's security forces tried to undercut the . planned protests. At the time, authorities also cut off Internet . access and mobile phone networks, crippling communication among the . protesters and with the outside world. Case: Dressed in a white prison uniform, Morsi stood in a metal cage with members of his now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie.

Attack: His appearance comes as British holidaymakers are repeatedly told to stay indoors in Egypt's capital after 80 people died during a weekend of street clashes.

They are also alleged to have turned their back to the court to protest . their prosecution, according to the state television journalist. Meanwhile, . a prosecutor told the court that Morsi and the Brotherhood's acts 'were . committed with the terrorist aim of terrifying the public and . spreading chaos'. He added that they had plotted with foreign . groups to 'undermine the Egyptian state and its institutions.' The trial coincided with the third . anniversary of one of the most violent days of that revolution that . plunged the country into prolonged turmoil, and that eventually led to . the virtual collapse of the police and their withdrawal from the . streets. It is second time . Morsi has appeared in court since the coup. At his first appearance in . November, Morsi wore a trim, dark suit and appeared far less agitated, . though he interrupted the judge and gave long speeches, declaring . forcefully that he was 'the president of the republic'. Deaths: Supporters of Egypt's army and police at Tahrir Square, on the third anniversary of Egypt's uprising .

Palestinian movement Hamas and Lebanon's Shiite militant group . Hezbollah. The rest of the defendants are being tried in absentia. Prosecutors say Morsi was freed from prison illegally during the . 2011 revolution, with help . from the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Meanwhile, . on Friday, six people died in bombings that the Al-Qaeda-inspired group . Ansar beit al-Maqdis claimed to have carried out. And in the latest in the string of attacks on officials, gunmen on a motorbike shot dead a police general in a west . Cairo neighbourhood today. General Mohamed Saeed was leaving his . home when the criminals opened fire at him - shooting him in the . head and the chest before fleeing, security officials said.

Above, an Egyptian woman holds a poster of al-Sisi . Gen Seed, the head of interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim's 'technical department', later died in hospital. Morsi's appearance in court today is part of a relentless government crackdown on . the ex-president and his Islamist supporters that has seen 1,400 people killed . since he was deposed, according to Amnesty International. Most of those killed have been pro-Morsi demonstrators in street clashes with police and the former president's opponents. Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, is already on trial for . inciting the killings of opposition activists during his presidency. He also faces charges of espionage involving Hamas, with that trial due to . open on February 16, and for insulting the judiciary, for which a date . has yet to be set.

His trial comes a day after the Eyptian military's backing of . army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for presidency. Wildly . popular for overthrowing Morsi, Sisi is now expected to resign as army . chief and put himself forward as a candidate in the election scheduled . to be held by mid-April.

        "summary": "NEW: Justice, FDA investigators at facility tied to meningitis outbreak .\nThe outbreak has been linked to the Massachusetts compounding pharmacy .\nThe number of cases is now up to 214 with 15 deaths, according to the CDC .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- Criminal investigators from the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration were at a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company on Tuesday with a search warrant, a company spokesman said. Federal officials say that more issues have been reported with drugs from the New England Compounding Center, or NECC, which has been linked to a deadly multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis. FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson confirmed that criminal investigators were on site, but declined to answer questions regarding a warrant. U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz similarly said that personnel from her office and law enforcement partners were investigating allegations concerning the company. She added that it was \"entirely premature\" to suggest what the results of that probe may be. Fifteen people have died from the noncontagious meningitis associated with injections of a contaminated steroid produced by the NECC. As part of the ongoing investigation into the center, a patient with possible meningitis has been identified who received an injection of another NECC product, triamcinolone acetonide, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday. Also, a fungal infection from Aspergillus was reported in a transplant patient who received cardioplegic solution from NECC, the FDA said. Cardioplegic solution is used to induce paralysis of the heart during open-heart surgery. \"An investigation of this patient is ongoing; and there may be other explanations for their Aspergillus infection,\" the FDA said. The health care facility initially reported two transplant patients having infections from Aspergillus, the FDA said. The heart transplant patient received the cardioplegic solution in August, and the patient who received the triamcinolone injection was treated on September 19 -- both before NECC recalled its products, according to an official at the federal Centers for Disease Control, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. The NECC announced a recall of all its products October 6. The FDA said \"the sterility of any injectable drugs ... produced by NECC (is) of significant concern, and out of an abundance of caution, patients who received these products should be alerted to the potential risk of infection.\" The CDC reported Monday the number of meningitis cases increased from 205 to 214, spread across 15 states. Two of the cases are a \"peripheral joint infection\" that specifically affects a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow, officials said. The cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, produced by the NECC. Some 14,000 people may have received the injections, the CDC estimated last week. Meningitis outbreak: What are compounding pharmacies? A Minnesota woman, Barbe Puro, filed a lawsuit Thursday -- which may be the first from the outbreak -- against tthe NECC. In it, she alleges she was injected in September with a tainted batch of steroids from the NECC. Meanwhile, members of Congress expanded an investigation into the outbreak. In a letter to the director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy, leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce noted the FDA sent the NECC a warning letter in 2006 \"detailing significant violations witnessed\" by investigators the previous year. Woman sues over outbreak . Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also accused the NECC last week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide. Plus, the state's pharmacy board mandated that all Massachusetts compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC. Steroid injections common for back pain sufferers . Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. CDC: Tests may not detect meningitis fungus . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.",

Record numbers of British couples are heading abroad to get married in a bid to avoid the spiralling costs of UK weddings, a study revealed today. More than a third of couples have booked a wedding abroad, research suggests - a 15 per cent hike compared to figures for previous years. That means as many as 80,000 Brits will shun the UK in favour of a foreign wedding over the next 12 months. Hard to beat: Couples are heading abroad to get married in their droves thanks to a combination of spiralling wedding costs in the UK and a desire for warmer weather . The average cost of a UK wedding has topped more than \u00a318,500 and a rate rise from the Church of England will see 40 per cent added to the cost of church weddings from January next year. Yesterday Elvin Eldi, from foreign exchange provider Travelex, which conducted the research, said: 'It seems that the increasing costs associated with weddings these days, combined with the unpredictable British weather is driving many Brits to celebrate their nuptials abroad. 'With the pound at a 22 month high against the Euro and the likes of Spain and Portugal boasting less than half the average rainfall of the UK, it's little wonder we're saying 'I do' overseas.' The study asked 500 engaged couples why they will ditch UK shores to get hitched. It found three in ten said 'saving money' was one of the biggest reasons behind the trend. Being able to invite fewer guests and combining the wedding with a hen and stag do, were also cited as further helping to drive the cost of an overseas weddings down. One in three couples said a ceremony away from home was a great excuse for avoiding unwanted guests. When asked how much they thought they could save by heading abroad, 30 per cent of couples predicted that they would be up to \u00a35,000 better off. One in three of the couples getting married abroad revealed they had deliberately cancelled UK wedding plans as a result of the increase in costs. It is expected that the number of weddings in the UK will fall to an all-time low next year. Savings: With the average UK wedding costing \u00a318,500, couples say they can shave \u00a35,000 from that price - and still have their dream wedding - by travelling to foreign climes . Italy was cited as the most popular destination, with more than one in five (22 per cent) of the couples questioned revealing they have booked a wedding venue in the country. It comes as a recent rise in the value of the Pound has knocked nearly nine per cent off the cost of a wedding in the Eurozone. It means that couples getting hitched in Paris, just over two hours on a train from London, could save nearly \u00a31,000 off the cost of a \u00a310,000 wedding in the UK. Laura Hutchinson, from Oxfordshire has moved her wedding from Buckinghamshire to the Italian Lakes. She said: 'We're getting married in May next year and had originally booked a venue in the local area. 'We'd deliberately kept it small to . keep the cost down but then we got a call from the vicar saying he was . going to have to increase the fee for getting married in our local . church. 'It was when we started looking . around for another venue that a friend said they'd recently got married . in Italy. 'We checked it out and discovered we could have a similar . wedding as in Oxfordshire, and get everyone over for less than in the . UK.' Daring to say 'I do' in the desert is also a popular choice with Brits, with 20 per cent saying they are heading to Las Vegas. The Caribbean and Hawaii were also common destinations. Amanda Statham, Travel Editor at You and Your Wedding said: 'Getting married abroad has been a popular option for British couples, particularly in Europe, ever since the onset of budget airlines, which brought hundreds of romantic destinations and the promise of good weather within easy and cheap reach. 'We've been inundated with the numbers of British couples looking for advice on where to marry abroad.' The research also highlighted how a basic wedding abroad can come in at less than half the price of a basic UK marriage ceremony. The cost of a chapel wedding in Las Vegas starts at around US$200 (\u00a3127), while in Hawaii, a wedding overseen by a licensed minister can cost US$380 (\u00a3242). Couples looking to get married in Greece, can book wedding packages at the Hotel Louise on Zante Beach that start at \u00a3535, which includes the venue, wedding ceremony and marriage certificate as well the wedding cake and flowers.",

        "article": "Germany has ratcheted up its row with America over CIA spying in the country with the immediate expulsion of the agency\u2019s Berlin chief. The dramatic rebuke to Washington comes after Germany\u2019s intelligence agency, the BND, uncovered two cases of alleged American spying in a week. The U.S. official was told to leave the country in a public signal of Angela Merkel\u2019s fury over US spying on Germany which in the past has included repeated snooping on her own mobile phone. A NATO ally expelling the spy chief of a friendly country is an extraordinary move but Mrs. Merkel has public opinion behind her. New polls show that many Germans want increased independence from America because of its snooping programme. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for 'greater trust' between the U.S. and her nation - code for demanding Americans stop spying on the NATO ally . 'The representative of the US intelligence services at the United States embassy has been asked to leave Germany,' a German government spokesman said. 'The request occurred against the backdrop of the ongoing investigation by federal prosecutors as well as the questions that were posed months ago about the activities of US intelligence agencies in Germany.' The move came a day after Berlin police searched the home and office of a German military intelligence official alleged to have been spying for America. The suspect is a foreign country specialist in the German defence ministry\u2019s political department and has not yet been charged. German military intelligence alerted prosecutors after the suspect was found to have 'met suspiciously often with US contacts', according to Spiegel Magazine. A week ago a German intelligence agent was arrested after handing over German secrets to the US in exchange for cash.The 31-year-old employee of the BND stands accused of selling 218 top secret German intelligence documents he downloaded on to a USB stick for 25,000 pounds. Last year documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA employee, revealed that the agency had been monitoring Mrs Merkel\u2019s mobile phone.

        "summary": "The government is getting near-daily reports of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission .\nMore than one million small drones have been sold  in the past few years .\nThe Federal Aviation Administration tightly restricts the use of drones, which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane .\nSmall drones usually aren't visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they're made of plastic or other composites .",
        "article": "The government is getting near-daily reports - and sometimes two or three a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission, federal and industry officials tell The Associated Press. It's a sharp increase from just two years ago when such reports were still unusual. Many of the reports are filed with the Federal Aviation Administration by airline pilots. But other pilots, airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well, said the officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Growing trend: Brian Wilson launches a small drone equipped with a video camera to fly over the scene of an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York . Michael Toscano, president of a drone industry trade group, said FAA officials also have verified the increase to him. While many of the reports are unconfirmed, raising the possibility that pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone, the officials said other reports appear to be credible. The FAA tightly restricts the use of drones, which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine. Small drones usually aren't visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they're made of plastic or other composites. 'It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart,' said Rory Kay, a training captain at a major airline and a former Air Line Pilots Association safety committee chairman. In the way: The government is receiving reports nearly every day - and sometimes two or three times a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission . Bird's-eye view: A remote controlled model aircraft flies over the Washington Nationals spring training baseball workout in Viera, Florida . 'So far we've been lucky because if these things are operating in the sky unregulated, unmonitored and uncontrolled, the possibility of a close proximity event or even a collision has to be of huge concern.' The FAA requires that all drone operators receive permission from the agency, called a certificate of authorization, before they can fly their unmanned aircraft. Most certificates limit drones to 400 feet in altitude and require that they remain within sight of the operator and at least five miles away from an airport. Exceptions are made for some government drones. The military flies drones in great swaths of airspace in remote areas designated for military use. Customs and Border Protection flies high-altitude drones along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. Jim Williams, who heads the FAA drone office, caused a stir earlier this year when he told a drone industry conference that an airliner nearly collided with a drone over Tallahassee, Florida, in March. The pilot of the 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet reported the camouflage-painted drone was at an altitude of about 2,300 feet, five miles northeast of the airport. The FAA hasn't been able to find the drone or identify its operator. In some cases the FAA has 'identified unsafe and unauthorized (drone) operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws,' the agency said in a statement late Tuesday. The FAA also said rogue operators have been threatened with fines. Aviation safety expert John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, said he's skeptical of some of the reports because most of the small drones currently being sold can't reach the altitudes cited by pilots. Still, 'it needs to be run to ground. That means a real investigation, real work done to determine just what these reports mean,' he said. More than one million small drones have been sold worldwide in the past few years, said Toscano, the official with the drone industry group. It is inevitable that some will misuse them because they don't understand the safety risks or simply don't care, he said. 'This technology has a phenomenal upside that people are still just trying to understand,' he said. 'As unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident, it's not going to shut down the industry.' The FAA is expected to propose regulations before the end of the year that would allow broader commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds. The FAA prohibits nearly all commercial use of drones, although that ban is being challenged. So far, the only commercial permits the agency has granted have been to two oil companies operating in Alaska and seven aerial photography companies associated with movie and television production. But the ban has been ignored by many other drone operators, from real estate agents to urban planners to farmers who use them to monitor crops.",

        "article": "By . James Rush . US Air Force and RAF pilots had a mid-air row in the skies over Norfolk after the American pilot accused a Tornado of flying too close to parachutists during an exercise, according to a new report. The pilot of the American MC-130 transport craft filed a near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter, claiming it came too close to the parachutists it had dropped near the village of Sculthorpe last November. After the US pilot radioed a warning to the British fighter, the Tornado pilot radioed back that he 'had every right to be here' according to a UK AirProx Board (UKAB) review of the incident. The aircraft came within two miles of each other at their closest point, according to the UKAB, which investigates near-misses. The pilot of an American MC-130 transport craft filed a near-miss report about a Tornado GR4 fighter (file picture shows an MC-130 aircraft) The USAF pilot claimed there was a 'high' risk to the parachutists during the incident. But the RAF pilot, flying one of several Tornados in the area in November 7, told the UKAB they had been visible at all times and the severity of the incident was 'low'. Local military air traffic control reported it as 'negligible'. The UKAB report said the USAF pilot was . 'clearly frustrated by the continued presence of the Tornados' but it . had determined there was no risk to the parachutists. After the US pilot radioed a warning to the British fighter, the Tornado pilot radioed back that he 'had every right to be here' according to a UK AirProx Board (UKAB) review of the incident (file picture shows a Tornado GR4) The report states: 'The Board quickly agreed that both the MC130 and the Tornado pilots were entitled to be operating in the area and blocks reported.' Some members of the investigation board felt the Tornado pilots could have been more flexible, it said. It added: 'However, members felt that the mis-match in perception could quite easily have been prevented with the application of effective co-ordination between these two units who both commonly use the busy East Anglian airspace.'",

        "article": "President Barack Obama is going to a top group of American business leaders Wednesday, where he's hoping to make his pitch for his agenda to the business community ahead of an incoming Republican majority in Congress. Obama will tout economic gains in the private sector at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, where he's also looking for support to advance issues like tax reform, trade and infrastructure, a White House official said. The group, an association of top U.S. CEOs whose companies employ more than 16 million people, is a powerful force on Capitol Hill, spending more than $12 million in lobbying in 2013 according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The organization could be an important ally for Obama on key issues as he looks to bridge the gap with Republicans on issues with some common ground, like tax reform. While traditionally backing Republican candidates and policies, the business community hasn't pushed back as strongly against Obamacare as the GOP and have pushed leaders on Capitol Hill to rally around comprehensive immigration reform. And Obama will need to keep business leaders on his side over the public fight over Obamacare that is sure to flame up as the employer mandate kicks in at the beginning of next year. Obama could generate some good will as he spotlights the economic gains of his presidency: 10.6 million jobs added to the economy in 56 months, a booming stock market and near-record corporate profits, the White House official said. \"As the President has said, he is eager to work with the new Congress wherever possible to make the next two years as productive as possible, and will look to the business community as a partner in these efforts to continue to grow our economy and create opportunity,\" the official said. The official did not mention immigration reform, but the topic could come up as he takes questions from a group of business leaders during the event that comes just weeks after Obama announced his executive actions to reform the immigration system and give legal status to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants. Like other business groups, Business Roundtable didn't fully embrace Obama's executive action, though the group didn't rebuke it as Republican leaders did and the group's policy director on immigration has said he's hopeful Obama and Congressional Republicans can work together to pass immigration legislation. Obama's meeting with the business group comes just hours before he meets with incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon.",

        "summary": "British thinker Edmund Burke often considered the \"first conservative,\" David Frum says .\nYet Burke would differ from the radical individualism of today's U.S. conservatives, he says .\nFrum says Burke saw the importance of community, continuity and responsibility .\nFrum: Two new books show the need for taking Burke's philosophy seriously today .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- Would the \"first conservative\" recognize modern conservatism? The conservatism of recent days has been a conservatism of radical individualism: a politics that sees its job as protecting society's \"makers\" from society's \"takers.\" Yet the man most often credited as the founder of modern conservatism, the 18th-century British thinker-politician Edmund Burke, saw things very differently. Against the politics of \"I want, I want, I want,\" he emphasized continuity, responsibility and community. That was a tough teaching 200 years ago, and it remains a tough teaching today. It's not a surprise that it often goes unheard. This year, however, Burke's tough teaching is again getting the articulation it deserves, thanks to two distinguished books by two rising conservative thinkers, one British, one American. Jesse Norman is a British member of Parliament who strongly identified with Prime Minister David Cameron's modernizing conservatism. His book was first published in Great Britain under the title \"Edmund Burke: Philosopher, Politician, Prophet\" but then rereleased in the United States under the pithier \"Edmund Burke: The First Conservative.\" As Norman tells it, Burke was a thinker and politician who rejected the demands of \"I want\" in favor of the duties of \"you should.\" In Burke's words: . \"[T]he state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties.\" Burke rejected both the \"I want, I want\" of people who expect ever more generous social programs from government -- and the \"I want, I want\" of bankers and brokers who wish to be allowed to stake huge gambles with other people's money. \"Except in reaction to the most extreme necessity, [Burke's] politics is one of moderation. He was an early supporter of free markets, but only within a strong context of personal probity, law, market norms and trust.\" Norman's Burke forcefully critiques the disintegration of society into personal atoms, each seeking only its own personal economic betterment. \"[T]he individual is not simply a compendium of wants, human happiness is not simply a matter of satisfying individual wants, and the purpose of politics is not to satisfy the interests of people living here and now: it is to preserve an evolving social order which meets the needs of generations past, present, and future.\" Make no mistake: Norman's Burkean politics is conservative politics. Burke defended free enterprise and private property rights. Burke's contemporary Adam Smith, author of \"The Wealth of Nations\" and founder of modern economics, saluted Burke as the only person whose ideas had corresponded with his own without any prior communication between the two. Burke favorably reviewed Smith's books, and the two men became friends. Yet Burke could also forcefully denounce the abuse of economic power and the corruptions of wealth. Norman again: \"[H]e regarded as his greatest achievement his campaign to restrain the influence, greed and self-dealing of the East India Company, and to insist on the accountability of private power to legitimate public authority.\" Here is a conservative who has much to say in the era of predatory finance and selective bailouts. A politician himself, Norman shrewdly appreciates that Burke's contributions emerged from an active career. Burke understood the limits of the possible because he himself had often bumped up against them -- hard. Burke spent only a few months of his long political career in office; he passed most of his parliamentary career estranged from the government of the day and exerted almost all of his influence in writings and speeches from the back benches. Norman bumped up one of those limits himself. In September, he voted against his own party leadership on a proposed intervention in the Syrian civil war and was stripped of his party leadership position. In politics, yet separated from it -- that is the place and role to stimulate fresh political thought. The author of this year's second great work on Burke, Yuval Levin, is located both closer to -- and simultaneously further from -- political power even than Norman. A former domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush, Levin now edits the flagship conservative policy magazine, National Affairs. At the same time, he is one of the most influential advisers of Rep. Paul Ryan, the former GOP vice presidential nominee; you might say that Levin now holds the Irving Kristol chair as a one-man Republican brain trust. Levin presents his new work on Burke as a study of a fierce debate that erupted in the 1790s between Burke and his one-time friendly acquaintance, Thomas Paine. Both men were migrants: Burke, Irish-born, had moved to England; Paine, English-born, moved to the American Colonies. Paine had given words to the American Revolution in his pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which became, after the Bible, probably the most widely read book in the America of the 1770s. Burke had urged compromise with the Americans in speeches in Parliament and then, after it was too late for reconciliation, urged peace and acceptance of independence. Fifteen years later, however, those two former allies bitterly quarreled. Burke's 1790 book, \"Reflections on the Revolution in France,\" eloquently and prophetically warned that revolution would end in blood and tyranny. Paine wrote a rebuttal to Burke, \"The Rights of Man,\" published in 1791. He transplanted himself to France to lend personal support to the new regime and was elected to the French National Assembly. To his surprise -- but probably not to Burke's -- Paine ended up in a French prison cell when his preferred faction lost power in late 1793. But he was not guillotined, and he lived and kept writing, becoming probably the first writer in English to propose something prophetically like the modern welfare state. In \"The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and the Birth of Left and Right,\" published in December, Levin argues that Paine deserves equal billing with Burke as a founder of our modern political debates. Levin sets each thinker as a standard and corrective for their modern descendants. Yet as Levin himself seems well aware, it is the conservatives who have drifted further -- and who need correction more. Levin's Burke often seems to be debating -- not against his contemporary Paine -- but against our contemporaries of the libertarian right. \"Burke essentially denies the relevance (though not necessarily the existence) of abstract, individual, natural rights. He defines instead some practical rights to the benefit of society. And those benefits do not amount to freedom or power. In fact, some of the benefits of society to which men have a right involve restraints on their freedom and their passions.\" And again: . \"Human beings cannot live in society if they follow their wants and passions unrestrained, and so one of the rights of citizens is to have their passions brought under some control. Thus society guarantees some liberties and some restraints, and precisely how these are balanced is in normal times a matter of prudence, not absolute principle.\" And once more, this time maybe most tellingly: . \"Where Paine imposes on government the obligation to respect the freedom of action of each of its citizens, Burke imposes on government a much less exacting (if somewhat more demanding) obligation to meet the wants of the people and advance the interests of the complex social whole.\" It is Paine, Levin's non-hero, who speaks the language of the tea party -- and Burke, Levin's hero, who rejects maximum individual rights in favor of a theory of social obligation. Burke sees, and Levin sees with him, that a politics of egoism and individualism leads to the dissolution of the institutions a conservative will want to protect. As Levin concludes: \"Today's conservatives are thus too rhetorically strident and far too open to the siren song of hyper individualism. ... They could benefit by adopting Burke's focus on the social character of man [and] from Burke's thoroughgoing gradualism.\" These are wise and needed cautions -- and phrased with the cautious wisdom necessary to make them acceptable to conservatives who do not wish to hear what they most need to know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.",

        "article": "Southampton have completed the signing of England goalkeeper Fraser Forster for a fee of \u00a310m from Scottish champions Celtic. Saints boss Ronald Koeman revealed after Saturday's 1-0 pre-season friendly loss to Bayer Leverkusen that a deal appeared close for the  Celtic stopper, with the clubs having reportedly agreed a fee and the player having already completed a medical. And on Saturday evening the club released a statement on their website confirming a four-year deal for the 26-year-old. Presence: The 6ft 7in keeper has completed a move to Southampton after a successful spell at Celtic . Koeman said: 'Fraser is a very talented player and we are delighted to be able to bring him to Southampton. This is another important part of our rebuilding process ahead of the start of the season. 'The fact that he has worked with Dave Watson before means we already know all about his strengths and weaknesses, and I am confident that we will be able to help him improve even further. 'Fraser is the perfect fit to help complement the players we already have, and he will add a lot of quality to the squad. 'He is an exciting English player with a very good reputation within the game and, at 26, he will enjoy the best years of his career at Southampton.' Top class: Forster saved two penalties in first leg of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against Legia Warsaw . Celtic will bank \u00a37.5m from the sale, with Newcastle United set to bank 25 per cent of the fee under the terms of the deal struck when they sold the player to Celtic two years ago. The sale of Forster has been pushed through despite the Champions League reprieve that saw Celtic progress to the play-off round in place of Legia Warsaw in the wake of UEFA\u2019s punishment for the administrative error which resulted in the Polish side fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski. That means Craig Gordon, who has not played a competitive match in more than two years, will now start for Ronny Deila\u2019s side against Slovenian side Maribor, who will host the first leg later this month. The appointment of England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson to Ronald Koeman\u2019s backroom staff has been key to Forster\u2019s move and his arrival will put former Celt Artur Boruc\u2019s place at the club in doubt. Forster recently travelled with the England squad to the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals, where he worked with Southampton's new Senior Goalkeeping Coach, Dave Watson. The Northumberland-born custodian began his career with Newcastle United, and had loan spells at Stockport County, Bristol Rovers and Norwich City before joining Celtic in 2010. After winning three league titles and two Scottish cups as well as gaining UEFA Champions League experience during his time in Glasgow, Forster now moves to St Mary's ahead of the 2014/15 campaign. International honours: Forster's impressive form for the Scottish champions has earned him two England caps .

        "article": "(CNN) -- Ebola may have faded from the headlines in the United States, but the threat -- to Africa and the rest of the world -- remains. This month, the Senate Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on Ebola, including testimony by Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He noted that the CDC had lowered its estimate of the number of cases likely to emerge in West Africa. Despite this positive news, Ebola remains largely out of control in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization announced this month that Guinea is \"relatively stable,\" but the recent spread of the virus into Mali only confirms the need for a greater sustained effort to combat Ebola at its origin. That's why many experts are cautioning that declaring the emergency over is premature. And it's why the Obama administration and key members of Congress are requesting $6.1 billion to beef up our ability to eradicate Ebola and prepare for future epidemics. There are two reasons why this emergency is far from over. First, as long as Ebola rages in West Africa, health care systems in the United States and elsewhere will need to remain on high alert. There is no way to assure that Ebola -- or other known and unknown biological threats -- will be contained without the ability on a global scale to identify, manage, eradicate or even prevent these diseases from spreading. Improving our capacity to develop vaccines, respond to crises overseas and develop other countermeasures for dangerous viruses are vital. Second, the death from Ebola of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas was a powerful illustration of how unprepared we are to deal with large-scale biological threats. Few of the almost 5,000 hospitals in the United States are at the level of Bellevue Hospital Center in New York, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the University of Nebraska Medical Center or the handful of other facilities that have been designated as ready to handle Ebola-like illnesses. Why aren't we ready? Part of the problem is that budget cuts over the last decade have slashed the federally funded Hospital Preparedness Program and special disaster funding for public health agencies. Indeed, since 2008, some 50,000 public health positions have been eliminated due to funding cuts. For many public health agencies, even getting routine work done, never mind responding to crises, is proving a challenge for many communities in the United States. The emergency funds being sought to respond to Ebola here and in Africa are critical to helping protect the American public. The recent U.S. experience of Ebola was a wake-up call. But if the country hits the snooze button once the media coverage fades, we'll have missed a critical moment to deal not just with this deadly illness, but with future disasters, too.",

Juventus, who were coming off the back of a 3-2 victory over Olympiacos in the Champions League, took the lead in the 24th minute when Llorente rushed in to tap home the rebound after Paul Pogba's shot was parried by Antonio Mirante.

The home side took a surprise lead when Federico Barba headed home a corner for his first Serie A goal seven minutes into the second half. Former Middlesbrough striker Massimo Maccarone doubled Empoli's lead three minutes later before Filip Djordjevic headed in a consolation for Lazio. Palermo could have recorded their fourth win in five matches but Franco Vazquez saw his penalty saved by Orestis Karnezis and Paulo Dybala headed off the upright.

No bail was set, and none was requested by the prosecutor. The 44-year-old actress, who penned a 2004 memoir about her long road to sobriety, was arrested around 7:30 p.m. Sunday on the Lower East Side of Manhattan after she was seen making a purchase from a drug dealer, police said. Investigators charged her with criminal possession of a controlled substance, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum one-year sentence. The Monday afternoon arraignment took about 15 minutes, during which the actress was read her charge. O'Neal did not enter a plea, which is not necessary at an arraignment. Her next court date is scheduled for July 28. At 10, O'Neal won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the movie \"Paper Moon.\" She is the daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, who starred in the 1973 film, and the ex-wife of tennis star John McEnroe, with whom she has three children.

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:19 EST, 11 March 2013 . A new mother 'blinded by love' was recruited to act as a getaway driver for her boyfriend in 30 burglaries just weeks after giving birth, a court heard today. James Parker, 24, and girlfriend, Charlotte Hall, 21, carried out a month-long crime spree during which they targeted dozens of homes in Lincoln over Christmas. The thieving couple snatched presents and . jewellery valued at over \u00a315,000. Hall, who had no previous convictions, embarked on their first burglary just a month after giving birth to a boy, the couple's first child. Guilty: James Parker, 24,\u00a0 (left) recruited his girlfriend, Charlotte Hall, 21, (right) to act as a getaway driver in a Christmas burglary campaign . But she was spared jail after a judge described her as a 'stupid girl' who was blinded by love and fell for a criminal. Sentencing Hall to a 12-month suspended prison term, Judge Sean Morris admitted: 'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.' Jailing Parker for two years and four months, Judge Morris told him it was an aggravating factor that he had recruited his partner and the mother of their newborn child. Lincoln Crown Court heard the couple were responsible for nearly 30 burglaries and attempted break-ins carried out over the Christmas period in 2012. Among the items stolen by the pair were a 100-year-old family bracelet and a set of \u00a31,200 pearls bought as a Christmas present. Other property taken by the couple, who even raided one house on Boxing Day, included a lap-top computer containing sensitive personal information and a watch given to a victim by his mother. 'Stupid girl': New mother Hall, pictured outside Lincoln Crown Court, acted as getaway driver for her boyfriend Parker. She had no previous convictions . The court was told Hall drove Parker 15 miles in her Fiat Punto car to Lincoln where most of the burglaries occurred while the owners were out. Much of the stolen property was recovered when police raided the couple's home in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, two days after Christmas. In total police estimated the couple made over \u00a315,000 from their criminal activity. Their victims included an elderly couple in poor health who were away visiting relatives for Christmas and a woman who now felt unsafe in her home of over four decades. The court heard Parker had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty and was jailed for four years in 2009. 'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.' Judge Sean Morris . Sunil Khanna, mitigating for Hall, said she was just 20-years-old when she met Parker. 'She chose to ignore things that were said about him,' Mr Khanna told the court. 'She got pregnant, they got a property together but unfortunately he was made redundant from his job cleaning farm machinery on October 24. Their son was born on October 31.' Hall tried to resist when Parker turned back to crime, Mr Khanna added. 'In her words he wore her down and he persuaded her if she remained in the car and did not go in to the property or on to the land then she had done nothing wrong. She accepts she was naive.' Following her arrest Hall co-operated fully with police. In total she admitted five charges of burglary in December last year and asked for 21 other offences to be taken in to consideration. Parker pleaded guilty to the same five break-ins and asked for a further 23 offences to be taken in to consideration. Mark Watson, mitigating for Parker, said he accepted being the 'driving force' behind the break-ins. Sentencing Hall to 12 months behind bars suspended for 18 months, Judge Morris told her: 'You richly deserve to go to prison. If there is one thing a burglar needs it is somebody to drive him and look perfectly innocent. That is you.' But Judge Morris added: 'It is clear to me you are a stupid girl who fell for a man who got you into crime. I don't mean to be impolite, love blinds may be a better way of putting it.' Hall was also made the subject of a six month nightly curfew and placed under the supervision of a probation officer for 18 months. Jailing Parker for 28 months, Judge Morris added: 'This was a campaign of burglary during the Christmas period when there was rich pickings to be had in peoples' homes. It was the season of goodwill to all, you broke some hearts.' Speaking after the hearing DC Glen Wright, from Lincolnshire Police, said: 'As the judge said this was a campaign of burglary over the Christmas period. I think he was right in that Parker was the driving force as Hall was a young lady with no previous convictions.' One of the burglary victims said: 'As a result of these two I now feel vulnerable in the home I have lived in for 40 years.'",

Hero: Steven Izegbu, 28, saw the assault from his home over the road and wrestled the attacker to the ground. Mr Izegbu had become a British citizen just hours before . A man grieving the death of his wife daubed 'I love you' in blood on a church wall as he attacked parishioners during a violent rampage, a court heard today. Malcolm Holland, 56, armed himself with a meat cleaver and a lock knife before launching the attack at St Barnabas Church in St Paul\u2019s Cray, near Orpington, Kent, last July. Wearing a Halloween mask, he smashed up cars, broke into the church hall and assaulted two singers from the local music group, Croydon Crown Court heard. He was finally stopped by a have-a-go hero who had become a British citizen only hours earlier. Holland, who already had a history of mental illness before the death of his wife last year, said to his victims: 'My wife was taken away from me, where was your God?' A judge today spared him a prison sentence, deciding instead to section him under the Mental Health Act. Nicholas Dunham, prosecuting, told the court that Holland began the attack by damaging windows and assaulting the church rector\u2019s husband. Shouting 'My wife died of cancer and you did nothing about it', he smashed up two cars parked outside the rector\u2019s house. He then broke the glass in the church\u2019s front door, causing members of local ladies\u2019 barbershop chorus Velvet Harmony, who were practising there, to barricade themselves inside a hall. The judge heard that Holland burst into the church hall where the women were hiding and set upon Yvonne Burr, who is in her 80s.\u00a0 Mrs Burr tried to defend herself with a walking stick but Holland punched her in the face and then kicked her after knocking her to the ground. Heroine: Gillian Page was left bruised after she bravely tried to to stop Malcolm Holland attacking Yvonne Burr, 84 . When fellow group member Gillian Page, in her 60s, came to Mrs Burr\u2019s rescue, she was also assaulted and left with bruises. The rampage only came to an end when local man Stephen Izegbu, 28, confronted Holland.\u00a0 Mr Izegbu had been made a British citizen hours earlier. 'Mr Izegbu\u2019s home overlooks the church and, when he saw the attack on the elderly ladies, he rushed across to intervene,' Mr Dunham told the court. 'After being hit on the head with a crutch, which caused heavy bleeding, he wrestled Mr Holland to the ground and kept him there, screaming and shouting, until the police arrived.' Officers inspecting the scene found the words \u201cI love you\u201d painted in blood on the wall. Police also recovered a meat cleaver and a lock knife which Holland admitted were his but did not use in the attack. Judge . Daniel Flahive sentenced Holland to serve a hospital order under the . Mental Health Act in addition to a restriction order after hearing . evidence from the doctor who is treating him. The . court heard that Holland, who has a son, began suffering anxiety and . depression after being taken hostage during a robbery at a petrol . station. The sentence means he will be sectioned in hospital until those treating him consider that he is no longer a risk to the public. Crime scene: St Barnabas Church in St Paul's Cray, south-east London, was cordoned off after the attack in July . Smashed windows: The church rectory suffered damage in the terrifying attack which left several people injured . The judge also praised Mr Izegbu, saying: 'The bravery he showed should be marked and if it is possible he should be paid \u00a3500 from public funds.' Holland, of Silverdale Road, St Paul\u2019s Cray, had already admitted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four counts of assault by beating, three counts of damaging property and two charges of having an article with a blade or point. Eiran Reilly, for the defence, told the court that his client could not remember the incident and had been drinking after failing to sort out problems with his benefits when it happened.",

        "article": "By . Zoe Szathmary . Police at a California concert venue claim a woman was asked to move to a different area because her baby was at risk in the pit with her - though the woman claims it was because she was breastfeeding in public. A video taken at a Brad Paisley concert on Thursday shows Chula Vista police speaking to 30-year-old mother Megan Christopherson, NBCLosAngeles reported, who was there with her baby and another daughter. 'My child that is actually sleeping and I'm getting escorted by police,' she says through tears as she is led out of the pit. Scroll down for video . Mother: Megan Chistopherson, pictured, said the issue on Thursday night was really because she breastfed her baby daughter in public . Incident: A Chula Vista police officer, left, tells Christopherson her location in the pit puts her baby at risk. Christopherson, right, is seen upset in the video . 'Having your child where you are at, when the next bands start coming out, they're going to be even louder than what was already down there, okay?' the officer says to her in the video. 'You're child doesn't have hearing protection on,' he continues. 'The crowd is going to start surging forward. Where you're at your child could get crushed, so we're afraid of your child getting crushed and we're afraid of your child's eardrums being hurt, okay? That is borderline, probably child endangerment. 'You have two options, okay? They can re-seat you somewhere else, they can put you in another seat where you can be safe, or you can get a refund on your tickets. It's up to you; it's your call.' In the video, Christopherson tells police she was at the same venue for a Tim McGraw concert in the pit with her baby and wasn't told to move. Christopherson also says that security guards photographed her breastfeeding and told her to stop - though the police officer claims 'this has nothing to do with the breastfeeding part.' Witness: Carmen Cooley-Graham, pictured, claims the incident was about other concert-goers in the pit upset Christopherson was in public breastfeeding . Christopherson tells police she wants her tickets refunded and turns down the offer to be moved to a different area. The officer tells Christopherson that if she refused to leave the pit, she would have been charged. He says they contacted the District Attorney's Office - and that she cannot receive officers' badge numbers unless she identifies herself. She told 10News the incident 'was completely a cop-out.' 'They're trying to cover this up because they know they legally cannot remove me for nursing,' she said. The statement from Chula Vista police says officers spoke with Christopherson after security had already asked her to move and cited safety concerns. Witness Carmen Cooley-Graham, who also spoke to 10News, wrote on the Chula Vista police Facebook page 'I don't know mom but I stood next to her for 2 hours and saw everything first hand- This is about BREASTFEEDING!! they had no issue-security guard was 2 people down from her and never once said anything until breastfeeding which no one could see. 5 girls tried to cut in front of her and when we all said no they texted a Elite security friend- then it became a breast feeding issue.' var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 634; p.config.height = 400; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The aircraft that Capt. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger heroically landed in New York's Hudson River began its long ride Saturday to an aviation museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Airbus A320, sans its wings and tail section, left a warehouse in Harrison, New Jersey, for the journey south, according to Shawn Dorsch, president of the Carolinas Aviation Museum. \"It's very hard to miss,\" Dorsch said of the fuselage. \"It's not covered.\" The museum has invited the 155 crew members and passengers from the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" incident for a June 11 arrival reception, at which Sullenberger is the scheduled keynote speaker, Dorsch told CNN. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 left LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the frigid Hudson. Rescuers quickly reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings. Everyone was rescued. Sullenbeger, who retired in March 2010, and other crew members became instant celebrities. J. Supor & Son Trucking and Rigging Co. in New Jersey has donated the considerable cost of transporting the aircraft, Dorsch said. About 40 vehicles are in the entourage, which reached Rutgers University later Saturday. Because the rig's height won't allow the plane to go under older interstate bridges, some of the move will be on other highways, where wires and some stoplights will have to be temporarily moved, Dorsch said. The plane will be shown off at the Charlotte museum's main hangar. \"It will be on display almost as soon as it arrives,\" Dorsch said. US Airways and Airbus mechanics will reassemble the aircraft, including its wings and tail section. Much of that work will be completed by the fall. Sullenberger's uniform, passenger belongings and other artifacts will be part of the display, he said. The cabin will look much as it did during the flight, Dorsch added. Between 30,000 and 35,000 visitors visit the museum annually. Dorsch expects that number will triple within 18 months of the exhibit's opening. Most of the flight's passengers still live in the Charlotte area, he added. The incident represents the height of technical achievements in safety and human heroism, the museum president said. Dorsch recalled taking the next flight after Flight 1549 and seeing the plane in the Hudson River. \"I was thinking, 'That could have been me,'\" he said.",

Most brides have a dream wedding that they try to create for their special day. For this bride, it's perhaps questionable whether this was what she envisioned for her wedding day for all those years. Regardless, it's clear from the beaming smiles on the faces of both the bride and groom, as they stand knee deep in freezing, flowing waters of a salmon river in Alaska, that this is the perfect wedding for them. Scroll down for video . Groomsmen holding fly fishing rods watch as Kadie and Dake Schmidt exchanged their vows, knee deep in a salmon river in Alaska . Bridesmaids look on as Kadie and Dake Schmidt, right, exchange a kiss at the end of their wedding ceremony . Flanked by supportive bridesmaids and groomsmen, wearing protective long waders, the happy couple exchanged their vows to the sound of the running river in the remote but beautiful setting. Kadie Walsh and Dake Schmidt, both local fishing guides, opted for a rather nontraditional salmon fishing theme for their entire wedding. The couple's rings were presented each in the mouths of two king salmon and both the bridesmaids and groomsmen were carrying fishing rods complete with flower posies throughout the ceremony. Stunning setting: It was arguably a beautiful setting for the ceremony, with Pillar Mountain in the background. The majority of the wedding party kept their feet dry, watching from the shoreline . Unafraid of getting their hands messy, the couple then caught their own pair of pink salmon to commemorate their special union . Shortly after the newlyweds were married, they were each handed a rod and both caught their own pair of handsome pink salmon on the Buskin River, on Alaska's southern Kodiak island. While marrying in the freezing fishy waters of a fast-flowing river in Alaska might not be everyone's cup of tea for their special ceremony, Mr and Mrs Schmidt, it appears, couldn't have been happier with the arrangement. The setting might be unusual but some elements of the special day followed the traditional course, including Kadie's minor make-up touch-ups from the bridesmaids . Impressed: Clearly enjoying the salmon-themed wedding, one groomsman stopped to watch with awe as two large king salmon are removed from the ceremony .",

        "article": "By . Pat Hagan . Taking digoxin daily could reduce a man's risk of prostate cancer by 50 per cent . A drug that costs little more than \u00a31 a month could reduce a man's chances of developing prostate cancer by half, new research shows. The drug, called digoxin, is already widely used to treat thousands of patients with heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. It is made from chemicals originally derived from foxgloves, one of Britain's best-known flowering plants. The latest breakthrough, by scientists in the U.S., suggests men who take the drug every day may be much less likely to develop a prostate tumour. It's thought that digoxin stops prostate cancer cells from growing by lowering levels of a protein called HIF-1. This protein is vital for malignant cells to flourish because it controls the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumour with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to survive. The findings, published in the journal The Prostate, are in line with a 2011 study which found the same drug appeared to have a powerful effect on breast cancer - also by blocking the effects of the HIF-1 protein. It could mean the drug, for which nearly five million NHS prescriptions are issued every year, could one day be used alongside other treatments in the early stages of cancer. Nearly 40,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 10,000 men die from it - the equivalent of more than one an hour. The risks increase with age, with men over 50 more likely to develop a tumour, and there is a strong genetic element to it. In a bid to find new ways of beating the disease, scientists have been exploring the powers of existing drugs - such as digoxin - that are already used for other diseases and are therefore cheap and readily available. In 1785, country doctor William Withering noticed a remarkable improvement in a patient with congestive heart failure after they took a traditional herbal remedy made from foxglove. He identified that the active ingredient was a substance called digitalis and wrote about his findings more than 200 years ago in a book entitled 'An account of the foxglove and some of its medical uses'. Digoxin stops tumours growing as it lowers the levels of a protein which is vital for tumours to flourish. The protein controls the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumour. Image shows prostate cancer cells . Drug company giants like GlaxoSmithKline eventually turned it into a tablet called digoxin, used for heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke. It has been used for decades on the NHS and has been taken by millions of patients with heart defects -costing around \u00a31.30 for a 28-day supply. Now the hope is it could tackle cancer too. However, the drug can have side effects such as nausea, headaches and breast enlargement in men and has even been linked with an increased risk of death from cardiac conditions in some people. Digoxin is made from chemicals originally derived from foxgloves, one of Britain's best-known flowering plants . It's unlikely to be given to healthy men to prevent tumours but could be used alongside other treatments when cancer has first been diagnosed. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre, both in Seattle, looked at just over 1,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2002 and 2005. They studied health records to see how many had been taking digoxin for heart conditions before they fell ill with cancer and compared the results with a similar-sized group of cancer-free men from the area. The results showed that men on the drug were between 42 per cent and 56 per cent less likely to develop a prostate tumour, even when researchers allowed for other factors that might increase the risks - such as having a family history of the disease. Their results also match those from a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who in 2011 found digoxin appeared to stop the growth of prostate cancer in nearly one in four men. In a report on the latest data researchers said: 'These findings support the growing evidence that digoxin has potential anti-tumour activity. Larger studies are warranted to evaluate the potential role of the drug in relation to prostate cancer development and progression.' Cancer Research UK said it was too early to say if the drug could be used to prevent prostate cancer and stressed the numbers involved in the study were small. Health information officer Dr Indi Ghangrekar said: 'If men are worried about their risk of prostate cancer, or notice any unusual or persistent bodily changes, like difficulty passing urine or needing to urinate more often, they should talk to a doctor.'",

        "summary": "New figures have been released under Freedom of Information laws .\nThey show that 323 under-18s were fired on in 2011 .\nIt was also revealed that in 2010, 74 children were threatened by having the Taser's sights trained on them without firing the weapon .",
        "article": "By . Daniel Martin . Tasers are being used by police against children as young as 11 almost every day, figures have revealed. Armed officers discharged, targeted or threatened to use the 50,000-volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year \u2013 an 11-fold increase from the first year they were cleared for use against under-18s in 2007. It emerged earlier this year that a girl aged just 12 had been shot by police with a Taser device in St Helens. Other children aged 11 have been threatened by officers with the weapons, forced have admitted. Widespread: In 2011 Tasers were used 323 times against under-18s . Critics pointed out that the revelations about the controversial of Tasers by the police come at a bad time for forces \u2013 just as they are \u2018in the dock\u2019 over their conduct in the Plebgate scandal. In the first year of officers being cleared to Taser children, they were used just 29 times in England. By 2009, this total had increased to 135. New figures released to Parliament show that one year later, in 2010, the weapons were used 339 times against children. By 2011 \u2013 the latest year that figures are available, the total stood at 323. The figures were not broken down into whether the guns were fired, or whether officers targeted children with a red dot laser to threaten them. Sophie Khan, solicitor-advocate specialising in Taser-related injuries and director of Police Action Centre, said she was appalled by the findings \u2013 and called for the use of Tasers on children to be prohibited. \u2018It is shocking that Tasers have been used on under 18s nearly once a day for the last two years,\u2019 she said. \u2018Tasers should only be used on children and young adults if there is no other feasible way to restrain them due to the specific health risks they could suffer. If the Taser is fired at their chest there is a higher risk they will suffer a cardiac arrest. \u2018The statistics show that the Taser is being used in contravention of the Taser Policy and Guidance, due to the dramatic increase in their use on under 18\u2019s. This needs to be addressed by the police forces immediately before there is a serious injury caused to a child or young adults.\u2019 Shocking: The weapons use 50,000 volts of electricity to stun people whom the police need to restrain . David Green, chief executive of the Civitas think tank, said: \u2018It seems there is a risk of misuse of Tasers, that the police will use them as an on-the-spot punishment. \u2018These figures come at a time when the police is in the dock over perceived untrustworthiness.\u2019 In one of the most shocking cases, Merseyside Police shot a 12-year-old girl in St Helens as she brandished two knives and threatened to harm herself. At the time a spokesman said: \u2018The Taser was deployed as a means to safely detain the girl and prevent serious harm to both her, the public and the officers. \u2018The girl was uninjured and was subsequently arrested and cautioned for the offence.\u2019 Freedom of Information requests have revealed that over the past three years, at least six children aged only 14 have been shot with Tasers, four ages 15 and 13 aged 16. Children as young as 11 have been threatened. The latest figures, released following a parliamentary question asked by Lib Dem backbencher Julian Huppert, did not break down the 2011 figures into the way the stun guns were deployed. But figures for 2009/10, released last year, show that of the 114 usages against children, 31 had been shot with Tasers \u2013 where an officer pulls the trigger shooting out a pointed barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric shock. Another 74 were \u2018red dotted\u2019 - a threatening gesture by officers pointing the Taser at the child pinpointing exactly where the barbs will hit their body with a red \u2018sniper\u2019s\u2019 dot. 'Get a grip': Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said the statistics uncovered were 'alarming' Experts say even deploying the red dot is still very threatening and can constitute assault. On 18 occasions the Taser was \u2018drawn\u2019 by police as a show of force, while in nine cases the \u2018drive stun mode\u2019 was used to stun a suspect. Only specialist officers can use Tasers at present, but last year the Police Federation called for every officer to be armed with one. There are 12,000 Tasers on the streets. Official guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers states that \u2018children and adults of smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of Taser currents than normal adults of average or large stature\u2019. The 2008 document added: \u2018Until more research is undertaken to clarify the vulnerability of children to Taser currents, children and persons of small stature should be considered at possible greater risk than adults.\u2019 Last night Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem MP who uncovered the statistics, said: \u2018It is very alarming that hundreds of children are having Tasers used against them every year. \u2018Whilst of course they do have a role, the Home Office should have a better grip on exactly when they are being used. \u2018It\u2019s alarming how many children are being targeted. It seems that, step by step, we are moving closer to a militarised police force rather than a civilian police force.\u2019 Last year police were accused last night of behaving like \u2018thugs with weapons\u2019 after firing a 50,000-volt Taser into the back of a blind man. An officer mistook stroke victim Colin Farmer\u2019s white stick for a samurai sword and discharged the stun gun \u2013 leaving the retired architect writhing in agony on the ground. Last night a spokesman for the Home Office said: \u2018The Home Office and the police have rigorously tested Taser and independent medical assessments have concluded that the risk of serious or life threatening injuries is low. \u2018They are only used by officers who have been carefully selected and trained and in situations where there is a serious threat of violence. \u2018Taser provides the police with an additional tactical option that is less-lethal than conventional firearms and there have been no reported serious injuries or deaths in the UK directly linked to their use.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A day after an explosion rocked its offices in Mexico City, Mexico's state-run oil giant Pemex says it's too early to speculate on the cause of the deadly blast. At least 33 people -- mostly women -- were killed in the explosion, Pemex chief Emilio Lozoya said at a news conference Friday. More than 100 were injured, including 52 who remain hospitalized. Watch: Blast rocks Mexico City . Lozoya was asked if he believed Pemex, the powerful but often criticized state oil monopoly, was the target of a bombing, but he declined to speculate. Experts from Mexico and abroad are investigating the scene to determine the cause, he said. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam similarly refused to rule out possibilities. \"We have experts in everything, absolutely everything,\" he told reporters, adding that investigations are under way to determine whether the blast was the result of an accident or an attack. Some witnesses have reported smelling a strong odor of gas after the blast. It is a complicated investigation that \"cannot be explained in a few hours,\" Lozoya said. The priority, Lozoya said, is providing support to the victims' families and rescuing anyone who may remain trapped. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited victims in the hospital Friday, offering condolences and promising help. The explosion happened Thursday afternoon at an administrative building in the Pemex office complex. \"People were screaming. ... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground,\" said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast. Paramedics quickly arrived and started pulling people from the rubble. Thousands of people work at the Pemex headquarters, which includes a 54-story building that is nearly 700 feet tall. The annex where the explosion happened is adjacent to the tower. The oil company's production capabilities have not been harmed, and operations and oil production will continue Friday as normal, Lozoya said. Employees at the Pemex annex said that the basement of the building, where he explosion is believed to have originated, housed a water treatment facility, storage areas and archives. The first floor, which also was heavily damaged, is where the company's human resources team worked. One employee, Silvia Hernandez, recounted how she was finishing up her workday at another building and standing in line to clock out when she heard a blast. \"I saw the explosion of glass, people bleeding; it was something very shocking,\" she said. \"I can't say more because the memory makes me nervous. I was terrified, anxious.\" A bridge that connected her building with the annex collapsed, likely trapping employees, she said. Another employee, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution, spoke about his failed attempt to locate his brother within the rubble. The man smoked cigarette after cigarette in the predawn hours of Friday as he waited at the medical examiner's office to claim his brother's body. More than 100 relatives waited outside the offices with him. The man said he was among the employees who began rescue efforts in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. He knew his brother worked in the human resources area, which had been damaged, so the man covered his face with a rag and ran there to search for him. The man said he removed debris and helped rescue others, but never reached his brother. By then, professional rescuers arrived and took over the job of looking for survivors.

        "summary": "Government ordered to urgently tackle Britain's pollution problem .\nThe European court yesterday ruled the UK was in breach of EU law .\nIt said Britain should have plans to tackle air pollution in place by 2015 .",
        "article": "Smog swallows up the London skyline. The European Court of Justice has said the Government must urgently do something to halt Britain's terrible air pollution . Ministers must urgently tackle Britain\u2019s abysmal air pollution, the European Court of Justice ruled yesterday. The UK has repeatedly failed to meet clean air targets, leaving most of our cities clogged with pollution that is estimated to kill 29,000 people a year. The European court yesterday found that the UK was in breach of EU law and should have created plans to tackle air pollution in 16 cities by January 2015 at the latest. Under existing plans, the worst areas - including London, Birmingham and Leeds - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030, campaigners say. Britain breached EU targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems. It is still nowhere near adequate levels, and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the EU deadline. The European court, which is based in Luxembourg, ruled that the UK\u2019s Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the Government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame. The Government is also facing a separate \u00a3300million fine for failing to meet the EU\u2019s air quality directive on pollution. Some 16 areas including Greater London, Greater Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and the West Midlands are currently in breach of the targets. The problem was dramatically illustrated in April when a thick smog enveloped the country, forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the case against Defra, the Government\u2019s environment department, said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out London\u2019s planned \u2018ultralow emissions zone\u2019 to cities across the country. The plan, drawn up by Boris Johnson, will mean charging diesel car owners \u00a310 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis. ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: \u2018Thousands of people die because of air pollution every year. This ruling will save lives by forcing the Government to finally take this issue seriously.\u2019 London's St Paul's Cathedral is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital . Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: \u2018This European Court of Justice judgement is a damning indictment of the Tory-led Government\u2019s total failure to tackle the UK\u2019s air pollution. \u2018Air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities, tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet David Cameron\u2019s government has done nothing to solve the problem. \u2018The European Court of Justice has now demanded that the UK take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution.\u2019 Manchester city  (pictured) is among the worst centres for smog and pollution in Britain . Maura Gillespie, of the British Heart Foundation, said: \u2018This judgement means the UK Government is finally being held to account for their breach of air pollution limits. \u2018Breathing certain pollutants is proven to exacerbate existing heart conditions and put vulnerable people at greater risk of a heart attack. \u2018The public expect the air we breathe to be safe. Officials must act now to improve the quality of the air we breathe.\u2019 And Friends of the Earth Campaigner Jenny Bates said: \u2018UK air quality is a national disgrace - tough measures are long overdue.\u2019 The ruling came as the European Environment Agency published its latest annual air quality report, which showed that almost a fifth of people living in British cities are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels up to 50 per cent above EU limits. A picture taken in 2007 shows factories in Stirlingshire, Scotland, belching out smoke . MP Joan Walley, chair of the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee, added: \u2018Ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade. \u2018It is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air.\u2019 A Defra spokesman said: \u2018Air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of NO2 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010. \u2018We have built on this by committing \u00a32 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles, green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action.\u2019",

Quinones had done two tours in Iraq, his neighbor says .\nThe former soldier faces multiple charges after a hostage incident .\nCharges say he expressed intentions to kill President Obama, former President Clinton .\nA search of his residence yields many weapons, an affidavit states .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- A former soldier arrested after a hostage incident at a military base in Georgia faces multiple charges that include threatening to kill President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, according to federal court documents filed Tuesday. Robert Anthony Quinones, 29, of Hinesville, Georgia, was arrested Monday after the two-hour hostage situation at Winn Community Hospital on Fort Stewart, about 45 miles from Savannah, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Officials and a family member said he had demanded mental health care at the hospital. Quinones is charged with assault of a federal officer and kidnapping in the incident, which ended with the gunman's surrender and no injuries. After he was taken into custody and during interviews, Quinones \"expressed his plans, preparation and intentions to kill President Obama and former President Clinton,\" according to an affidavit filed in federal cour. \"Quinones detailed his studies of Secret Service protocols, sniper techniques and means of disguise and weapons concealment to implement his assassination plans.\" A search of his residence resulted in the discovery of 11 long guns, four pistols, multiple rounds of ammunition and dozens of bayonets and knives, according to the affidavit. Authorities also found books and manuals about FBI hostage rescue teams, Osama bin Laden, Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, the Russian Mafia and other topics, according to the affidavit signed by FBI and Secret Service agents. Quinones, when asked if he would kill Obama or Clinton if given a chance, said, \"Yes. On a scale of 1 to 10 about being serious, I am a 10,\" the affidavit said. Quinones was discharged from the military in February and had a civilian job at Fort Stewart, said the FBI, which released no other information on his military record. Quinones' mother, Janet Gladwell, told the Associated Press he was medically discharged from the Army months ago because he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A neighbor, Jerry Franklin, said he had known Quinones for several years. \"He was a good kid,\" he said. Franklin, 48, an Army retiree, said Quinones would talk with he and other veterans because they understood the stress brought on by combat. Quinones had served two tours in Iraq, said Franklin. \"All I know is he saw death,\" Franklin told CNN. \"Maybe they [the Army] should have helped him a little more,\" said Franklin, adding he was not blaming the military for the incident. Quinones might not have received sufficient individual treatment after returning from Iraq, Franklin said. Quinones worked at one of Fort Stewart's post-exchange stores. the neighbor said, adding he didn't believe Quinones had been treated at Winn Army Community Hospital, scene of Monday's hostage situation. The hostage incident started at about 4 a.m. Monday when the former Army serviceman entered the facility and demanded care, spokesman Kevin Larson said Monday. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Phillips, a senior Fort Stewart commander, told the Associated Press the former soldier told hostages he needed help for mental problems \"connected, I'm quite certain, to his past service.\" The gunman immediately took one hostage and went to the third floor, which houses the behavioral health unit, where he held two more people at gunpoint, including a nurse practitioner, Larson said. The nurse, an Army major, was able to calm the man and authorities started negotiations, Larson said. The gunman  eventually surrendered and was taken into custody for questioning, he said. Quinones was armed with an MP5 assault rifle, an AR-15 assault rifle, a 9 millimeter handgun and a .38-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. It accuses the gunman of pointing a firearm at an Army negotiator. Quinones' attorney, Karl Christian Zipperer, said late Tuesday afternoon he had just gotten the case and would have no comment.  A phone number for Quinones in Hinesville was disconnected. The suspect's initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, the FBI said in a statement.

        "article": "Jim Murphy has been elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party following a vote in Glasgow this morning. The MP for East Renfrewshire has elected with more than half the vote, ahead of Holyrood health spokesman Neil Findlay and former Scottish Executive minister Sarah Boyack. The leadership contest was sparked when Johann Lamont stood down suddenly, accusing colleagues in Westminster of treating Scotland like a 'branch office'. Jim Murphy MP, pictured, has been elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party following a meeting today . Kezia Dugdale, MP for the Lothian region, was also elected as the party's deputy leader. Murphy will lead Labour's challenge north of the border during next year's general election . Murphy, who was the favourite to win, became well-known for his soap box brand of pro-union patriotism during September's referendum on independence, which Scottish nationalists lost. An opinion poll in October showed the surge in support for . the SNP could leave Labour with just four of Scotland's 59 seats following the General Election, compared with the 41 they won in 2010. Another one by YouGov published in The Sun today said the SNP were now on 47 per cent, while Labour is on 27. The Conservatives have 16 per cent of the electorate's support with the Liberal Democrats languishing on just three per cent. The referendum, in which Labour joined forces with David Cameron's . Conservatives in the fight to stop Scotland ending its 307-year . union with England, exposed the cracks in Labour's Scottish . stronghold. Labour's failure was laid bare when it was left to former . Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, rather than the local party, . to rally fellow Scots against independence. Brown, 63, who has announced he is stepping down at the next election. Mr Murphy, right, was elected along with Kezia Dugdale, left, who is the party's new deputy leader in Scotland . Murphy was centre-stage during the referendum campaign, touring Scotland and giving speeches standing on his Irn-Bru crate. He won this morning's election despite the trade union movement supporting former bricklayer Neil Findlay. Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Murphy and Ms Dugdale's election. She said: 'I know that the challenges of leadership are never easy, so I offer my best wishes for the job they have ahead. 'While we will undoubtedly cross swords often in the months ahead, my door is always open to those who wish to find common ground and work together in the best interests of people in Scotland \u2013 something I hope we will have the opportunity to do.' Union Unite criticised today's decision to support Mr Murphy ahead of their preferred candidate. Pat Rafferty, secretary of Unite Scotland said: 'Neil Findlay offered a genuine alternative to the politics and policies that led to consecutive electoral defeats for Scottish Labour and the haemorrhaging thousands of members. 'Unite was proud to support Neil and his share of the vote is enough to show his popular policies have resonance among working people in Scotland. 'Arguably, Jim Murphy recognised this appetite for real change during the hustings, because as the campaign progressed his arguments became bolder on issues like taxation and a living wage. Jim now needs to turn words into action if he wants to start the process of re-building Scottish Labour.' Speaking after his victory, Mr Murphy said: 'This is a fresh start for Scottish Labour. A new generation is in charge. But it\u2019s only the beginning.' He said: 'Inequality is wrong. And Scottish Labour's mission is to end it. 'It makes me angry that kids from poor backgrounds are three times less likely to get good grades than those from prosperous backgrounds.' Labour leader Ed Miliband congratulated Mr Murphy and his new deputy leader. 'Jim showed in the referendum campaign that he is a fighter. He showed in the leadership campaign that he is a leader. I am going to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Jim in the campaign to get David Cameron out at the General Election. 'Jim has already shown how he will use increased powers for the Scottish Parliament for a new 50p top income tax rate for people earning more than \u00a3150,000. 'Together we will show how a Labour government can change the lives of working people in Scotland. 'The fight to get the Tories out is now on. It is a fight we intend to win.'",

The engineers, who have previously worked for aerospace giants such as Airbus, Gulfstream and Bombardier, have spent the past two years designing the luxury aircraft and believe the jet will be capable of flying between New York and London in three hours.

However, despite impressive engineering, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flight over the U.S. making popular flights such as LA to New York unlikely in the near future. Companies including Nasa and Boeing are currently trying to develop supersonic aircraft of their own to reduce the noise - or boom - that the jets make when breaking the sound barrier.

So it could come from a start-up. \u2018If I were to have another company in the future, which would not be any time soon, I think that would be the thing do,\u2019 he added.

Anti-capitalist activists protesting against the World Economic Forum in Davos have claimed responsibility for explosions that broke a window at a Zurich branch of Credit Suisse and blew up the postbox of the boss of commodity trader Glencore. Police confirmed on Friday that attacks had been made on a Credit Suisse branch in the upmarket residential area of Hottingen and a postbox in the lakeside suburb of Rueschlikon in the early hours of Thursday morning. Credit Suisse confirmed a security window of its branch had been shattered. Police said the damage, caused by an unidentified explosive device, amounted to several thousand francs. Targetted: A\u00a0 postbox outside a property owned by Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg was blown up by activists protesting against the World . Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland . A spokesman for Zurich police said investigations were continuing into who was behind the attacks and what had caused the explosions, while Glencore confirmed an incident had taken place on the property of CEO Ivan Glasenberg. No-one was injured in either attack. An unnamed group posted a letter on . the indymedia.ch website claiming responsibility for the attacks. The . letter said the group had targeted Credit Suisse and Glasenberg due to . their support of the WEF. In the letter, the activists . criticised poor working conditions at Glencore and said it had targeted . Credit Suisse for a host of reasons, including food price speculation, . mass job losses and 'betting against the Greek people'. Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg has been scrutinised for his company's involvement in mining operations in countries from Zambia to Colombia . Glencore's 2011 stock market flotation has led to increased scrutiny by environmental and anti-corruption campaigners over its involvement in mining operations in countries from Zambia to Colombia. Until the listing, Glasenberg, who grew up in South Africa and became CEO in 2002, had lived with his family in relative anonymity in Rueschlikon, a lakeside town about 6 km from Zurich where he moved in 1994. In 2011, left-wing activists claimed responsibility for a small explosion that broke windows at a hotel in Davos without hurting anybody.

        "article": "By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:05 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:15 EST, 30 January 2013 . This is the smirking drug-crazed yob jailed for three-and-a-half-years today after he beat up and robbed a care worker in the street. Monica Cismaru, 39, pleaded for onlookers to intervene as career criminal David Hindson, 33, grabbed her by the neck and demanded her . belongings in an attack he thought was 'funny'. The terrified woman gave desperate cries for help but passers-by ignored the crime, as Hindson even felt her neck to see if she was wearing a chain. Miss Cismaru, 39, who is originally from Romania, is so upset nobody came to help her she is too frightened to go anywhere on her own. Mugger: Monica Cismaru (right) was beaten up and robbed by David Hindson (left) who was jailed today after he grabbed her by the neck and demanded her belongings . Details of the horrific 'walk on by' incident emerged as Hindson, from Accrington, Lancashire, was jailed for three and a half years after admitting robbery and theft. Today Miss Cismaru was still too upset to talk about her ordeal last November. Burnley Crown Court was told the incident occurred while Miss Cismaru was walking through Accrington town centre at 8.10pm. Hindson who was leaning against a wall noticed the victim walk past him whilst she was chatting on her mobile phone. Scene: Hindson who was leaning against a wall in Portland Street (pictured) noticed the victim walk past so he went for her . Moments later she then felt somebody grab her around the neck. Miss Sarah Statham prosecuting said Miss Cismaru struggled to break free and tried to keep hold of her phone but Hindson pulled it from her grip. Criticism: Residents of Accrington (pictured) have been accused of turning a blind eye to the attack . He then kept his arm around her neck and then went for her shoulder bag, which contained important personal documents. Miss Cismaru continued to struggle, but the defendant took her bag and then made another grab for her neck, shouting : 'The chain, the chain.' She wasn't wearing a necklace and Hindson eventually ran off after a further struggle when there was nothing else to steal from the victim. The prosecutor said : 'She was absolutely terrified. She was crying, went back home and immediately telephoned the police. 'She was upset that nobody came to help her. Until the incident, she had always felt safe, but she is now frightened to go out anywhere on her own.' Hindson later confessed to robbing Miss Cismaru to a 16-year-old girl and appeared to find it 'funny'. He also asked how much he could get from selling the phones. Miss Cismaru's missing iPhone was later found under a mattress at the home of Hindson's girlfriend. None of the other property was recovered. It emerged after the mugging Hindson had sneaked into a house in the early hours of the next day and help himself to another mobile phone and handbag from the bedside cabinet of a mother as she lay asleep in bed. The court heard Hindson had been abusing drugs since he was 11 and had a cocktail of drink and cannabis in the moments before the mugging. He had 32 previous offences on his record, which included seven charges of possessing an offensive weapon, three of affray and four of assault. He was once described in court as 'dangerously out of control,' after threatening another woman with a knife and a shovel in separate attacks. In mitigation defence counsel Mr Daniel King said : 'At the time, he was feeling depressed and anxious. 'He had no permanent accommodation and drink and drugs - related problems. He had been drinking and taking cannabis. He really can't explain or excuse his behaviour in any way further than that.'",

        "article": "By . Sarah Griffiths . Coffee connoisseurs can relax knowing their beans will be brewed in the correct way with the help of a new iPhone app. The free app is a timer that advises people how long to brew certain types of beans, how much water to use and even when to stir the coffee. It lets coffee fans perfect the brewing process and then save their tweaks in the app so they can create their ideal cup again and again. Scroll down for video . Improving the daily grind: Brewseful is a free iPhone app (pictured) that advises people how long to brew certain types of coffee beans, how much water to use and even when to stir the coffee. It is largely a complex timer that walks people through the process using sound alerts . The Brewseful app is designed for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy using different varieties of ground beans and waiting for their beverage - not for people who are content with adding boiling water to a teaspoon of instant coffee. It firstly lets people calculate the ratio of water to ground beans needed, and set times reminding them when to pour in the water. It can also be used to discover how long to let the mixture steep, according to its Baltimore-based creator, Kevin Zweerink, who is a graphic design student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. To begin the process, connoisseurs need to select which type of bean they are using as well as the coarseness of the grind and the size of their cup, to work out the best coffee-to-water ratio. On track for the best brew: To get started, people have to enter what type of beans they are using and can save their favourites (pictured left). The app lets them create timers for each brew to use while making their cup of . coffee (right) so that it can beep when they need to move onto . the next step, ensuring precision . A recent . study has revealed that regardless of how precisely a person makes their . coffee, the brew releases more flavour if they gulp it down. Scientists said that taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly. They looked at \u2018sip volume\u2019 when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a \u2018higher aroma release\u2019. The . researchers said: \u2018The findings could be useful to understand the . factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of . coffee.\u2019 However, . the advice goes against that for other drinks, such as wine, where . people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the . maximum flavour and aroma. The app then generates a time for how long the process will take. Users can set alarms to remind them when to start pouring in water and when to stir, for example. \u2018Large numbers, clear alert sounds, and a bold progress indicator make it easy to keep your attention on your coffee,\u2019 according to the App Store. Because users can customise the process for a certain type of coffee, they can explore the subtle science of getting the best out of beans and make tiny tweaks to each cup they make until they reach the perfect formula. 'I came up with the idea for Brewseful . when I was just starting to become interested in nice coffee,' Zweerink told MailOnline. 'I was . using the regular stopwatch app on my phone, but I wanted a more . specialised timer that could help keep track of all the different . parameters that go into a really solid cup, something that would allow . me to make small tweaks and gradual improvements each time I brewed.' He does not think that his app will change the way people drink coffee, but he doesn't want it to, as he likes the way people have personalised rituals for making a cup. 'I hope that Brewseful can play a small part in keeping track of the details and help people find what tastes best for them,' he said. Science of coffee: Because users can customise the process . for a certain type of coffee, they can explore the subtle science of . getting the best out of beans and make tiny tweaks to each cup they make . until they reach the perfect formula. A ratio for a blend of Las Brumas is pictured left and a timer right . 'One of my favourite things about brewing my own coffee is the eclectic collection of objects that I get to interact with, all of which fit together not because they were designed as a system, but because they were designed with a common goal. 'I wanted to make a timer that works alongside any given brewing method, that addresses the concerns of making coffee rather than the concerns of doing so in any particular manner.'",

        "article": "By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 16:01 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 7 November 2013 . An outraged father is suing a child psychologist after she dubbed him an unfit parent because he refused to take his five-year-old son to McDonald's. David Evan Schorr, 43, an attorney from the Upper East Side, says in a civil lawsuit that he planned to take his son Max to their 'usual restaurant' on a recent custody visit but the child demanded to go to McDonald's and 'threw a tantrum' when he said no. The father drew the line at the unhealthy burger joint because he felt Max had been eating 'too much junk food,' the court papers state, so Schorr gave the boy an ultimatum: dinner at any other restaurant, or no dinner at all. McDonald's: Schorr drew the line at McDonald's, pictured, because he felt his son had been eating 'too much junk food,' the court papers state . 'The child, stubborn as a mule, chose the \"no dinner\" option,' the suit states. Not wanting to reward his bad behavior, Schorr stood his ground but when he dropped the hungry boy home later that night, he apparently tattled. The child's mother, Bari Yunis Schorr, with whom Schorr is in the midst of a bitter custody battle, immediately called their court-appointed psychologist Marilyn Schiller and reported the incident, according to the suit. The Schorrs married in a lavish ceremony at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan but just four years later, in 2011, Mrs Schorr sued her husband for a divorce. Lawsuit: Child psychologist Marilyn Schiller, pictured, is being sued after she allegedly dubbed New York father David Schorr an unfit parent because he refused to take his five-year-old son to McDonald's . She recently filed motions asking the judge to punish her ex for flouting court orders and for a judgment on nonpayment of child support, according to The New York Post. After Dr Schiller heard about the McDonald's incident, she demanded Schorr submit to a forensic examination before a custody trial with his estranged wife, the suit states. Dr Schiller allegedly only interviewed the child and his mother then told the court the father was 'wholly incapable of taking care of his son' and should be denied his weekend visitation. The furious father says he's had partial custody of his son for two and a half years and it's always 'run smoothly without incident.' Custody battle: After dropping his son home hungry, Schorr's ex-wife, Bari Yunis Schorr, pictured, reported the incident to the court-appointed shrink, the papers state . He says in the suit that he wished 'mightily that he had agreed to McDonald\u2019s in the first place' but believes he needed to set an example. Schorr is now demanding the shrink return the $2,750 he paid for the evaluation he claims was a sham and based entirely on the McDonald's incident. Dr Schiller told the New York Post she could not comment on the details of the incident, saying only: 'I am conducting a forensic evaluation on this matter. I will be issuing a confidential report to the court and the matter will be tried by the court.' Bari Schorr's attorney, Louis I. Newman, said the litigation did not involve his client and refused to comment. The custody trial resumes in December.",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- Sometimes Jaria Faraj Ali is so hungry that she ties a scarf tight around her waist to make her feel more comfortable. The Yemeni mother of six told the international aid group Oxfam that she has now resorted to begging because food prices are so high and she doesn't have an income. And in Pakistan, 28-year-old Asif Masih says he has to work at two jobs to buy enough food. \"I drive a taxi part time as well as work in an office because otherwise me and my family won't be able to eat,\" he told CNN. Their stories of hardship are echoed across the globe from Tajikistan to Peru where a recent spike in world food prices has hit the most vulnerable, and particularly in countries that rely on imported food. Rising food prices have been blamed on a number of factors -- for example, rising energy costs, changing land use for biofuel production, local conflicts, and an increasing demand for meat and dairy products. But 2012's severe weather events around the world have led to low yields in nations such as the U.S. that export grain. Oxfam fears climate change is responsible and that impoverished people could be facing a future of high food prices driven by extreme weather trends. Oxfam spokesperson Colin Roach said: \"High and volatile food prices spell misery for millions of people like Jaria who face a daily struggle to put food on the table. This is man-made misery in a world which produces enough for everyone to eat.\" A recent study commissioned by Oxfam into global warming and food prices, said: \"Against a backdrop of rising populations and changing diets which will see global food production struggle to keep pace with increasing demand, the food security outlook in a future of unchecked climate change is bleak.\" Oxfam-commissioned research on extreme weather and extreme prices . It has certainly been a tough year for farmers. While much of North America baked in the hottest July on record and the Mid-West suffered its worst drought in 56 years, the UK endured its wettest summer in a century. Back in September, CNN reported: \"From Ukraine to Yellowstone, in Pakistan and Kazakhstan, the skies have stayed clear, and the earth has been parched. And on the world's commodity exchanges, the prices of corn, soybeans, wheat and tea are surging.\" The driest season: Global drought causes major worry . UK cereal farmer Jeff Powell says it was the poorest harvest he had seen in 30 years of farming with low yields and poor quality grain -- and he warns that the full effects are yet to filter into the system. \"Your loaf is going to cost more money this winter without a doubt -- when we get to Christmas bread prices will be up a lot,\" he said. \"It's an absolute nightmare for anyone in the livestock industry -- especially pigs and dairy -- with feed prices going up they can only stand that for so long.\" In the U.S. state of Kansas, Donn Teske, who runs a prairie farm, said it was not unusual to have dry years but added: \"What we are finding though is that the extreme weather events are becoming much more extreme. Historically we haven't had these kind of conditions since the 1950s and before that the 1930s.\" Find out how high food prices affect people across the world . The implications could be serious. Michael Roberts, an associate professor of economics at the University of Hawaii, wrote in August that lower U.S. crop yields would impact the world's poorest and could lead to social unrest. \"For these people, a huge rise in grain prices is more than noticeable -- it can break their budget. In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots. Many pointed to wheat prices as a catalyst for revolutions in the Middle East, including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya.\" Oxfam says commodities futures markets are indicating there may be another spike in prices in early 2013, but expects high and volatile food prices in the medium to long term. It says governments should do more to prevent famine. \"Putting a stop to food price crisis requires a radical new approach to the way we grow, share and manage food,\" said Oxfam's Colin Roach. \"Governments must kick start the process by investing in small scale producers who feed billions across the developing world, regulating commodity markets; putting an end to biofuels policies which divert food crops into fuel; tackling greenhouse gas emissions which drive extreme and erratic weather and helping poor producers adapt to a changing climate.\" There was better news for consumers this week when the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that global rice production for 2012 was expected to outpace consumption, saying improved weather patterns in Africa and Asia had contributed to the rebound in rice inventories. And farmers are trying to adapt. Donn Teske says he will be stocking fewer cattle next year and trying to plant crops with less tillage to preserve the moisture. Some countries are also taking a longer term approach to reducing their reliance on food imports by looking for alternative staple crops. Nigeria has a population of 170 million and according to Debisi Araba, the special adviser to Nigeria's agriculture minister, the country spends 635 billion naira ($4 billion) annually on wheat and an astonishing one billion naira ($6.3 million) each day on rice imports. But Nigeria has a plan to combat this huge cost. Araba said Nigeria produces 34 million tons of the starchy root crop cassava every year and this can be mixed with wheat flour. He said Nigeria was planning to replace 40% of wheat flour with cassava and was ramping up production of rice. Araba believes the country will be able to produce 2.1 million tons of rice by 2015, first becoming self sufficient, and then able to export. Opinion: How Africa could feed the world . For other farmers, it may be more of a challenge to deal with any erratic weather patterns in the future. Jeff Powell said: \"Now with a wet autumn a lot of people are struggling to get their winter crops planted. If we have more years like this [2012] then we may aim to plant more crops in the spring... but the spring last year was bone dry. It's a bit of a catch-22.\" Are you affected by high food prices?

        "article": "He was a Republican president to no end, with some political pundits even arguing he may be the last, as support for the right-wing party - especially among Millenials - continues to wane. And now it seems that not even the daughters of George W. Bush stand behind his cause. Neither of the Texas-born twins - both 32 - have registered as Republican voters, it has emerged. According to The New York Daily News, Jenna Bush Hager is registered to New York's Independence Party, while Barbara Pierce Bush is not affiliated with any political party. She is however registered to vote in Texas, where she lives with her family. Family divided?: Both Barbara Pierce Bush (left) and Jenna Bush Hager (right) - seen here with their parents George and Laura Bush at Jenna's wedding in 2008 - do not consider themselves Republican, despite the staunch views of their father . 'Free thinkers': Jenna Bush Hager (left) and Barbara Pierce Bush (right) say they prefer to avoid the labels of political parties and consider themselves Independents . The Daily News reports that Jenna's registration was actually accidental. The newspaper said the younger twin intended to register as an Independent, however mistakenly ticked the Independence Party. 'Jenna registered to vote in New York soon after her daughter was born, and like all new moms, she was functioning on very little sleep,' a spokeswoman said. 'She mistakenly registered for the Independence Party.' In an interview with People in 2010, two years after their father was succeeded by Barack Obama, the women said they chose not to embrace any party. 'I don't really label myself as Republican or Democrat,' Barbara told the magazine. 'We're both very independent thinkers,' Jenna added. In January, a survey ranking the social and political attitudes of different generations showed that each successive generation had become more politically independent, according to Mother Jones. The survey, by the Pew Research Center, showed that 50 percent of Millennials described themselves as political independents and about 29 percent said they were not affiliated with any religion. Crucially, the study showed that voting patterns had been relatively consistent for the last 40 years, however after the George Bush presidency voters left the Republican party en masse.

        "article": "Marine archaeologists say they have uncovered a wreck from one of Kublai Khan's 13th century Mongol invasion fleets just yards off the coast of Japan. Scientists are hoping to be able to recreate a complete Yuan Dynasty vessel after the discovery of a 36ft-long section of keel just below the seabed off Nagasaki. Japanese legend claims that two 'divine winds', known as The Kamikaze, destroyed both of Kublai Khan's vast invasion fleets with the loss of thousands of troops. Watery grave: Marine archaeologists have found a 36ft-long section of keel from Kublai Khan's Mongol invasion fleet which sank off the coast of Japan in a typhoon in the 13th century . Historic: Kublai Khan launched to attempts to invade Japan from Korea, but both fleets were ravaged by typhoons known as 'The Kamikaze' - or 'divine wind' Using ultrasound equipment, scientists found the well-preserved wreck 3ft below the seabed and it is the first from the period to have an intact hull. Yoshifumi Ikea, a professor of archaeology at Okinawa's University of the Ryukyus, said the keel section could help remodel the 60ft warship. He said: 'This discovery was of major importance for our research. 'We are planning to expand search efforts and find further information that can help us restore the whole ship. 'I believe we will be able to understand more about shipbuilding skills at the time as well as the actual situation of exchanges in East Asia.' Artefacts: Cannonballs and stone anchors are among thousands of items found around the shipwreck off the coast near Nagasaki . Doomed: Thousands of Mongol, Korean and Chinese troops drowned or were slaughtered by Japanese samurai after the failed invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281 . Empire: Scientists used ultrasound to find the shipwreck three feet below the sea bed, where it has remained remarkably well preserved . More than 4,000 artefacts, including ceramic shards, ballast bricks, cannonballs and stone anchors have been found around the wreck, CNN reported. The hull will not be immediately salvaged, but the site will be covered with netting to prevent damage. The Kamikaze - two powerful typhoons that struck seven years apart - halted the Mongol expansion in the Far East. Historians say both attempts by the Yuan Dynasty to invade Japan ended in disaster. Thwarted: Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271 after removing opposition in the south of China and the Mongol empire, in blue, spread from Europe to the China coast at its height . Invasion force: Both fleets contained tens of thousands of well-armed troops who had initial success against Japanese samurai, but the typhoons devastated them . Armada: 900 ships sailed to Japan in the first invasion, and two forces of 4,400 ships took part in the second failed invasion . The first, in 1274, saw a fleet of reportedly 900 ships land at Hakata Bay and troops made initial inroads into Japan with their superior weaponry. But as a storm arrived, the Yuan force was forced to retreat back to their ships after the Battle of Bun'ei and it worsened into a typhoon which destroyed much of the fleet overnight, forcing the rest to limp back to Korea. In 1281, two separate forces of 900 and 3,500 ships carrying nearly 150,000 troops attempted another invasion. Initially, the Korean, Chinese and Mongol troops captured the islands of Iki and Tsushima, but they were thwarted by improved seawall defences on the the Japanese mainland. Vision: Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, united China under his rule and also led invasions into Vietnam before his death at the impressive age of 78 . Kublai Khan was the fifth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1294 and the grandson of Genghis Kahn. His forces established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271, setting up a capital near what is now Beijing, and he became Emperor of China. By 1279, he had removed all resistance from the Southern Song Dynasty and became the first non-Chinese Emperor to conquer all of China. After the heavy defeats and the deaths of his wife and son, he became grossly overweight and suffered from gout and diabetes. He died on February 18, 1294, at the age of 78 having handed over control of the Yuan empire to his son. Among his achievements was the introduction of paper currency in the Yuan empire. He also staged invasions in the north of Vietnam. Marco Polo's life story includes mentions of Kublai Khan, after he met him as a teenager travelling with his father. He was also mentioned in the 1797 poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in which he refers to his theoretical idea of building a 'Pleasure Dome'. At the height of its power, the Mongol empire extended from Eastern Europe, through Russia, Persia and on into Asia to include Mongolia, China and down into Vietnam. A second typhoon then hit the Tsushima Straits, destroying around 80 per cent of the fleet and seeing thousands of Kublai Khan's troops drowned or slaughtered by samurai as they managed to make landfall. Kublai Khan is widely believed to have rushed to assemble his enormous fleets in under a year - particularly in the second invasion - forcing shipbuilders to use river boats that were not suitable for the sea. He is even thought to have vowed to carry out a third invasion before his death at the impressive age of 78.

        "article": "The lawyers for a 35-year-old former Michigan high school tutor accused of having a sexual relationship with a student are trying to prove the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him. The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, will undergo two days of cross-examination. In that time he will be pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempt to show he was no victim. However the prosecution plan to use the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live. Charged: Abigail Simon, a 35-year-old math tutor, is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student . Trial:\u00a0The boy, who is 17 now, testified again Tuesday, saying the affair was mutual and text messages between the two were introduced that supports that contention . 'Coerced': Simon's lawyers say the young man  was the aggressor in the relationship and that he pressured the woman into having sex with him . Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone. Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified Monday. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I\u2019m scared that you\u2019re only 15.' Arrested:\u00a0Abigail Simon is seen here in a booking photo after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy last year . The pair were allegedly together between February 1 and April 26 of last year. Almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids. Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I\u2019m just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.' Inappropriate: Abigail Marie Simon was working at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids when she allegedly began a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old-student . Illicit: Simon allegedly carried out the affair at her apartment on the 300 block of Bridge Street. She is now living with her parents . The teen started undergoing questioning on Monday November 17. He denied that he slapped Simon before they started having sex with each other. He also laughed at suggests that he stalked Simon. Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.",

        "article": "Rookie full backs Nathaniel Clyne and Kieran Gibbs offered an encouraging glimpse into the future by playing an important part in breaking down Slovenia at Wembley. With no Leighton Baines, Glen Johnson and Ashley Cole on show, it was left to the newer generation to shine. And they made light of the fact they only had four caps between them before the game \u2013 compared to the 180 won in total by the aforementioned trio. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Nathaniel Clyne was comfortable in his own half and a threat going forward for England . England defender Kieran Gibbs also impressed against Slovenia after stepping in for Leighton Baines . Clyne and Gibbs are thoroughly modern full backs; quick, mobile and equally comfortable in either half of the pitch. They didn't lack in confidence either. Clyne, 23, was first to impress on his international debut. During a turgid opening 45 minutes, he was England's brightest attacking hope, one attacking burst left his marker flat-footed down the right-hand side led to a good chance for Raheem Sterling . Gibbs takes exception to a decision from the referee of England looks dejected . Clyne found himself regularly fending off Slovenia's Andraz Kirm (right) Clyne is a cool customer, his development in south London at Crystal Palace was a tough schooling and he has progressed nicely on the south coast at Southampton, who sit second in the Premier League. Given the nod ahead of ex-Southampton youngster Calum Chambers, Clyne took up advanced positions early on, always available to playmaker Jack Wilshere, and there was encouraging inter-play with Danny Welbeck down the right-hand side. Gibbs of Arsenal took longer to settle but can look back on the game with equal satisfaction, despite being England's only player in the book for catching Valter Birsa down the back of the leg as the Slovenian tried to shield the ball. Clyne (right) gets physical with Slovenian midfielder Kirm after getting the nod ahead of Calum Chambers . Clyne clears without fuss under pressure from Slovenia's\u00a0Andraz Kirm . To show his resolve, Gibbs responded immediately by winning the ball back and forcing a corner that led to Phil Jagielka's header being saved by Samir Handanovic. After England levelled, Gibbs \u2013 who will face long-term competition from Baines and Manchester United teenager Luke Shaw for his place \u2013 seemed to get forward even more. And he played an important part between Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling to help set up England's best goal of the evening, Danny Welbeck's third in a 3-1 victory. For so long, England were sluggish against Slovenia. If anything it was the energy of the two inexperienced defenders that kept them going through a difficult period. One senses Clyne and Gibbs will be given another chance by Hodgson, maybe in Scotland on Tuesday, though Shaw is also available for that one. Clyne (front row centre) and Gibbs (front row right) take their place in the starting 11's team photo . Leighton Baines was forced out of the side due to an injury picked up in England training . England boss Roy Hodgson was more than satisfied with the young duo's performance. 'I thought Nathaniel was excellent in his first game,' said Hodgson after the 3-1 win. 'He and Kieran Gibbs did well, particularly as Gibbs only got his call to play quite late because Leighton was going to be in the team. 'The two of them played high up the field like we wanted them to and they defended very solidly. 'Nathaniel has to be delighted with his debut and he and Danny Welbeck would have challenged Jack for his man of the match. But I thought Jack was outstanding.'",

        "article": "Divers have found a bizarre alien 'slime' in water-filled underground caves beneath Australia\u2019s Nullarbor Plain. Researchers were stunned to find life in the deep cave. They reported unique \u2018curtains\u2019 of biological material now known as Nullarbor cave slimes. A 'curtain' of slime found by Australian divers in water-filled underground caves beneath Nullarbor Plain . The researchers say the organisms that make up the Weebubbie cave slime community survive in a very unusual way \u2013 by oxidizing ammonia in the salty . cave water. They are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems . on the surface, the researchers say. Researchers Sasha Tetu, Katy Breakwell, Liam Elbourne, Andrew Holmes, Michael Gillings and Ian Paulsen from Macquarie University are exploring how this alien ecosystem works. They published their findings this week in the journal of the International Society for Microbial Ecology, showing that an unusual combination of microbes thrive in the Weebubbie caves in the underground system. 'Earlier studies on the community suggested that there was an unusual chemistry going on in the caves, but we didn\u2019t know how the microbes were making a living in the cave environment,' says the lead scientist Professor Ian Paulsen of Macquarie University. In order to find this \u2018missing link\u2019, the team of researchers made use of a range of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing of environmental DNA and scanning electron microscopy to take an in-depth look at the composition of the Weebubbie cave slime community. They found a dominant group of organisms in the cave slimes, known as the Thaumarchaeota. This community of microbes thrives in the total dark, independent of photosynthesis. The alien cave slime under a microscope: The slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty water and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface . Another of the alien slime communities found in the cave . It is thought that the inundations of the Nullarbor caves by the sea occurred a number of times in the past and so researchers suggest that the Weebubbie Thaumarchaeota may have a marine origin. 'We know that the Nullarbor Plain\u2019s karst system arose from the sea in the Middle Miocene period and so this may be a clue as to where the Weebubbie Thaumarchaeota came from,' says Professor Paulsen. The research team says this analysis shows that the organisms that make up the Weebubbie cave slime community survive by oxidizing ammonia in the salty cave water \u2013 and are completely independent of sunlight and ecosystems on the surface. 'It just goes to show that life in the dark recesses of the planet comes in many strange forms, many of which are still unknown,' says Professor Paulsen.

        "article": "(CNN) -- An accident in a tunnel at a construction project near Lake Mead in the Las Vegas area killed one worker and injured another on Monday, the agency operating the site said. The workers were constructing a mining operation underground when they were hit by a high-pressure release of grout, said Bronson Mack of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, a cooperative public agency formed in 1991 to manage the water resources in a region that includes Las Vegas. One worker suffered a fatal blow from the impact of the pressure release and died on the scene, Mack said. The other worker was taken to a hospital with unspecified injuries. No other workers remain in the tunnel at this time, according to Mack, and no one was exposed to harmful gases as a result of the accident. The fatal pressure release took place at a project known as Intake No. 3, which is under way near Lake Mead. The project is intended to give the authorities the ability to draw water from the Colorado River for the Las Vegas area and guard against water quality issues that are associated with continually dropping lake levels. The area is in the midst of moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The regional agency has undertaken a $2.9 billion capital improvement initiative, stretched out over 15 years, to address the region's water needs.",

        "article": "A blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a holiday company told her she would be unable to go on a flight because she would not be able to see the safety demonstration. Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, has been left 'absolutely gutted' by holiday company Thomson, after she and friend Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told that they would need a carer with them on the plane. The holiday company has since contacted Lauren's mother, Dawn, . 50, and said their staff will assist the two friends on the flight from . Manchester Airport to Palma, Majorca, next Wednesday. But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter, who was so desperate to get away on the break she canceled a planned operation, was now not confident enough to fly with them after the ordeal. U-turn: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were initially told that they couldn't fly with Thomson because they are blind . Lauren suffered mid-facial disfigurement in the womb because of . complications with her mother's pregnancy when hormones stopped being . produced. The condition, which is genetic, left Lauren blind from birth. It is so rare that it is known to affect just 23 people in the world and doesn't have a name. Thomson contacted her and said their . staff would assist the two friends on the flight from Manchester Airport . to Palma next Wednesday. But Mrs Wigglesworth said her daughter would not be taking up the offer. She said: 'She is gutted. 'And I am, as a parent. It was a huge deal for her to be travelling alone. She will not be going on holiday with Thomson. She has lost all confidence. 'She does not feel confident enough to be able to go and fly with them. 'Thomson said that they will assist . Lauren and Stephen on the plane. They got in touch and said they would . put someone on the flight with them. 'There is no reason at all why .

Backed down: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, who has had a . series of operations, has got her travel money ready for her holiday to Majorca . No go: Lauren Wigglesworth, 27, and Stephen Sherwood, 24, were told by Thomson it wasn't safe for them to fly because they are blind . The pair booked their \u00a3538 half-board five-night break at the the luxury C'an Picafort resort in January but were told two weeks ago that they couldn't go. Lauren was so excited about her holiday . that she had already bought all her holiday clothes, booked in to have . her hair done and got her Euros - but then was told she couldn't go. The . holiday company insisted that 'we are not able to allow them to travel . unaccompanied' but then offered the pair special assistance. However, after reading of the pair's . plight on the Mail Online, a company which specialises in holidays for . the blind has apparently offered the friends a break - for free. Mrs Wigglesworth said Traveleyes had . contacted her and invited her daughter and friend away in August, an . offer which she has accepted. Dawn told the MailOnline: 'It sounds fantastic and it means she still gets to do what she wants to do most - travel independently. ' Thomson said: 'Both Ms Wigglesworth and her friend completed a special assistance form, in which they stated they would need assistance to complete a number of safety related actions, such as putting on a lifejacket, on board the aircraft. 'These requirements are taken from the Department of Transport\u2019s Code of Practice that has been confirmed by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, to which Thomson and every other UK airline must adhere. 'Unfortunately, as Ms Wigglesworth and her partner are not able to complete these without assistance, we were unfortunately unable to allow Ms Wigglesworth and her friend to travel alone safely on this occasion.\u00a0 We understand that this must have been frustrating for her. 'With the departure dates being so close, and due to the delay in being able to inform Ms Wigglesworth she could not travel safely alone, as a gesture of goodwill we offered to organise a member of our Special Assistance Team to be present on the flight. 'Our team member would have assisted Ms Wigglesworth and her friend in the unlikely event of an emergency situation, however Ms Wigglesworth has not accepted this offer. 'Ms Wigglesworth has accepted a full refund and as a further gesture of goodwill we have offered Ms Wigglesworth the money back for the travel insurance she paid for, which she has also accepted.'",

        "article": "Kim Stevens has a problem that affects tens of millions of Americans.  If left untreated, it could lead to the death of someone she loves, someone who's part of the family. Stevens' dog Dodger, a black and gray mixed breed, is obese.  According to a new study, he's emblematic of a growing problem. The majority of adult dogs and cats in U.S. homes are overweight or obese, and the problem has gotten worse over the past year, according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention.  Fifty-three percent of adult dogs and 55% of cats were classified as overweight or obese by their veterinarians. \"I didn't notice the weight creeping on -- it was like all of a sudden he was just this fat dog,\" Stevens said as she and Dodger visited Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park. \"His weight is about 82 pounds right now, and he should be 62 pounds.\"  That means he needs to lose about a quarter of his weight -- equivalent to a 200-pound person needing to lose 50 pounds. The reason is pretty simple: \"Too much food and not enough exercise,\" Stevens said. iReport: 'There is no stopping this fatty' The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention report shows not only that more pets are overweight, but also that those with the problem \"are getting fatter,\"  said Ernie Ward, the group's founder. The annual study, to be released next week and given in advance to CNN, found that 25% of cats and just more than 21% of dogs are obese.  Both those figures are up slightly from 2010. About 41 million dogs and 47 million cats are overweight or obese, the study found. A long list of health dangers comes with the excess weight.  \"It's not a matter of if, it's when\" serious complications will strike, said Ward. These can include high blood pressure, \"crippling arthritis,\" diabetes and some cancers.  \"Their life is shortened by two or 2\u00bd years,\" said Ward, a veterinarian in North Carolina. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, which cites the association's annual study, said the diseases seen among obese pets \"are eerily similar to those reported for people.\" A central part of the problem, the pet obesity group found, is the growing \"fat pet gap:\" More and more owners are unaware their pets are overweight.  The study found that 22% of dog owners and 15% of cat owners characterized their pets as normal weight when the animals were actually overweight or obese. \"In simplest terms, we've made fat pets the new normal,\" said Ward. In many cases, the problem correlates to the obesity epidemic among people, he said. \"This is the sentinel for childhood obesity.  When I see dogs who are overweight, I see a child that's at risk for excess weight, because nobody's exercising. The kid's playing video games all day, the dog sits around all day,\" and \"everybody's eating poorly.\" Stevens said she needs to shed some weight, too. \"We'll do it together,\" she said. The fact that obesity has struck her dog is particularly telling.  Stevens does some work as a dog trainer.  \"To have a dog this heavy when you know better ... is embarrassing,\" she said. But she has a lot of company.  Thirty-nine percent of U.S. households own at least one dog, and 33% of households own at least one cat, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The pet obesity survey was conducted at 41 veterinary clinics across the country and included evaluations of a sampling of more than 600 animals.  \"Over the five years studied, these results have proven to be consistent and increasing at a gradual pace,\" the association said. While the obvious advice -- eat less, exercise more -- is the right starting point, there's more that pet owners should understand, Ward said. iReport: Dog packs on 60 pounds . Pet foods these days are \"more calorically dense\" than they used to be, yet owners are feeding their pets more, he said. If you're concerned your pet may be obese, it's important to work with a veterinarian, and not try to tackle the problem on your own, said Ward.  \"Diet is not about starvation or deprivation.  It's about gradual weight loss.\" In many cases, carefully measuring food and committing to exercise can do the trick.  But more severe cases need more extensive work. iReport: Fat cat makes floors creak . That's what helped Jane Whitehead's dog, Raleigh. In February 2006, he weighed a whopping 187 pounds. \"I swear, we didn't overfeed him!\" Whitehead said of Raleigh who, like Dodger, is a rescue dog. \"We would try giving him smaller and smaller portions of his regular food and he kept gaining and kept gaining.\" A series of tests found nothing wrong with him, but \"at a certain point when he had become so obese, he couldn't exercise at all.  We would try to walk him a little bit and he would just stop,\" said Whitehead, CFO of a business in Duluth, Georgia. A veterinarian switched him to \"super low-calorie food\" and put Raleigh on an underwater treadmill, which he loved. \"He lost enough that he could exercise on his own and go for walks with us.\"  The energetic Raleigh she loved was back. Within three years, Raleigh had cut his weight in half. There are few truly lost causes, Ward said.  And that's something critical for owners to know. iReport: A real-life Garfield . Beth Spiess of San Marcos, Texas, said her sheltie, Daisy, became so obese from over-feeding that she couldn't walk, and her previous owners wanted to put her to sleep. The vet refused and gave the dog to a shelter, where Spiess adopted her.  Daisy has lost 30 pounds. iReport: Daisy, before and after . \"It's hard to believe she is the same dog,\" Spiess told CNN in an iReport, though Daisy still needs pills to help with arthritis caused by the obesity. Cat owners can face more of an uphill climb in trying to get their pets to exercise, Ward said. Stacie Schafer of Brunswick, Ohio, said people often remark that her cat, Sophie -- now nicknamed Meatloaf -- \"is the fattest cat I have ever seen.\" Schafer has tried to get Sophie to run around like the other two cats in the home, but Sophie just isn't that interested. \"Cats don't jog,\" Ward said.  \"Cats by nature are anaerobic creatures.  That means they use sugar as their primary energy source. ... They sprint, they pounce, they leap.\" Schafer has tried diet cat food and portion control as well, with little results. Ward recommends families facing trouble work with veterinarians to find ways to bring down the weight. In the end, living a life in which you prioritize healthy eating and exercise for all members of the family, including domesticated furry friends, is the key, he said. That means no more treats -- \"calorie grenades\" -- every time your dog does a trick.  \"They want reward, praise, affection. We take the easy way out, reach into the cookie jar.\" It also means snacking on single-ingredient treats like celery, broccoli and asparagus. And it means moving to stay healthy and stay alive. \"Unless we really get a grip on this very quickly,\" said Ward, \"We're going to see an entire generation of pets that don't live as long as the pets I had when I was a child.\"",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The gap between Formula One's haves and have nots appears never to have been wider. While all-conquering Mercedes prepares for the title showdown in Abu Dhabi, a cash-strapped team at the back of the grid has been forced to ask for donations from F1 fans to fund its participation in the final race of the season. Caterham, like fellow minnow Marussia, has gone into administration and has missed the last two races in the United States and Brazil. Desperate to compete in the 2014 season finale, the team launched #RefuelCaterhamF1 with the express intention of raising \u00a32.35 million ($3.76m) -- and set a self-imposed deadline of Friday, November 14 to achieve the target. Caterham is using a method called \"crowdfunding,\" where individuals or companies making a pledge are incentivized, depending on the amount promised. The Caterham team's administrators turned to one of the market leaders in this specialized area, Crowdcube, to run the appeal with fans directed to its website to see what is on offer. About $5 dollars will get a funder a badge or T shirt. More expensive items would include a front wing from a 2013 car, with the highest prices reserved for individuals or companies wishing to have their name or logo emblazoned on the team's cars. The approach has provoked a debate within F1 as to its merits -- with the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone being typically blunt in his assessment. \"I think it's a disaster,\" he told reporters at last weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix. Luke Lang, the co-founder of Crowdcube, flatly rejected that criticism. \"I think that's a disappointing statement,\" he told CNN. \"Caterham has worked tremendously hard to compete in F1 and some of the goalposts have moved slightly over the last for or five years to make it even more difficult. \"I think comments like that are not particularly helpful.\" What is not in doubt is the appeal for cash has proved successful with over \u00a31 million ($1.6m) raised in the first two days of the appeal and the halfway target reached by Tuesday. Items such as the front wings or team overalls were proving particularly popular with donors. It was Finbarr O'Connell, the Caterham administrator and for now its team principal, who came up with the idea, and like Lang is unapologetic about the approach. \"There are 200 people in the (Caterham) factory who were not paid for October and they deserve as much support as they can get,\" he told CNN. \"He (Ecclestone) has now had races where two teams weren't there and three others were hinting at boycotts, so that's not good for him.\" O'Connell believes that getting Caterham to the start line in Abu Dhabi -- where there will be \"huge interest\" in seeing which of the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg takes the F1 title -- will help him firm up the interest shown by potential buyers of the team. \"We are not talking about crowdfunding a team, we are talking about a single stepping stone to showcase it to investors in a race setting. \"This is a sharp injection in the arm to cure an immediate financial crisis but they will only survive if a new purchaser comes forward,\" he added. Lang said this \"one-off\" approach was new ground for his company as well. \"It's a deviation from our usual business model where investors get equity shares or an interest payment in return for their investment,\" he said. \"But it was an opportunity we could not set aside because Caterham is such an iconic British brand and we are doing what we can to help out.\" Caterham is not even the first team with links to F1 to use crowdfunding to fund its activities. The iconic former Brabham team has raised over $400,000 by this method as it attempts to return to the grid after a 20-year absence. O'Connell is increasingly confident they will reach their ambitious target and line up on the grid on Sunday week. \"Interest all over the world is growing exponentially, a mixture of enthusiasts who want to buy expensive things and even non sports fans with sympathy for our cause,\" he said. \"People like Renault (Caterham's engine supplier) and Total Oil have also been incredibly supportive.\" After the initial flurry of interest, donations slowed a little ahead of Friday's deadline, but according to Lang this is a familiar pattern. \"There tends to be a real burst of activity, then a slight plateau in the middle, followed by a resurgence of interest as the deadline nears. \"There are over a quarter of a million views on the page and I am really confident they are going to reach their target.\" That will mean good news for Caterham's Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi, who has still to find a seat for the 2015 season. His Swedish teammate Marcus Ericsson has been signed by Sauber off the back of a big personal sponsorship package. Exactly how many cars will be on the grid in Abu Dhabi also remains an open question. O'Connell's firm Smith and Williamson is a key player in the UK restructuring business and he told CNN that his own sources within the industry were talking up a rescue bid for Marussia. Reeling from the horrific crash which has left its star driver Jules Bianchi in a critical but stable condition in a Japanese hospital, the Anglo-Russian team was dealt a further blow when its administrator announced last Friday that it had folded. \"The finality of that statement surprised me,\" said O'Connell. \"I still think there could be more positive news for Marussia ahead of the Abu Dhabi race,\" he added. The two points gained by Bianchi for a superb ninth placed finish in the Monaco Grand Prix left Marussia in ninth spot in the constructors' standings. It would leave them set for a $50 million payout under F1's complicated rewards structure, having pipped Caterham for the vital 10th spot in the championship in 2013. By contrast, Mercedes will be set for a near $100 million payout in prize money for claiming top spot after a dominant season. But their operating budget, like those of other top teams such as Red Bull and Ferrari, is in excess of $300 million, dwarfing that of teams such as Caterham and Marussia. They will surely never have to resort to what Ecclestone labeled the \"begging bowl\" employed by Caterham, but O'Connell has no regrets as he battles to save the team. He came up with the idea of using crowdfunding while cycling up the steep Highgate Hill in London on his way home, in some way symbolizing the uphill struggles of Caterham since it entered F1 in 2010. \"It's such an interesting proposition, the belief that a team could be reconstituted by fan power,\" he said.",

        "summary": "More than 2.5million Britons suffer from Type 2 diabetes .",
        "article": "A pill to treat or even prevent type 2 diabetes could soon be developed, according to scientists. A study on diabetic mice found a compound, produced naturally by the body, successfully restored their normal blood sugar metabolism. Researchers believe this could lead to people taking the compound like a daily vitamin to stop the condition from developing. Type 2 diabetes affects more than two million Britons and is linked to lifestyle (picture posed by model performing diabetes test) The findings have huge implications for the UK where there are at least 2.5million Britons who suffer from the disease. The compound, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), plays a vital role in the way cells use energy. Scientists in the US were able to normalise blood sugar levels in diabetic mice by injecting them with the chemical. At the same time the jabs lowered raised levels of cholesterol and triglyceride blood fats. The researchers are now working on a way of administering NMN to mice in drinking water. 'Once we can get a grade of NMN that humans can take, we would really like to launch a pilot human study,' said study leader Dr Shin-ichiro Imai, from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. RISK FACTORSIf you have two or more of the following, see your GP for a simple blood test... CLASSIC WARNING SIGNS . For many, the first signs of diabetes are symptoms caused by complications. So also watch out for the following... Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, is linked to an unhealthy lifestyle. The U.S. scientists triggered the condition in young, healthy mice by feeding them a high-fat diet. All had reduced levels of a molecule called NAD that harvests energy from nutrients and turns it into a form cells can use. In both mice and humans, NAD is derived from NMN made by cells via a chain of biological reactions. One of NAD's effects is activation of SIRT1, a protein that has been shown to promote healthy metabolism throughout the body. Although NAD is too toxic to be administered directly, the scientists were able to raise its levels in mice by injecting them with NMN. After the treatment, the animals showed dramatically improved responses to glucose. In the case of female mice, tests showed their ability to move glucose from the blood to organs and tissues had returned to normal. Male mice also showed an improvement, but were not completely normalised. The gender difference might be explained by hormonal effects, the scientists believe. Dr Jun Yoshino, also from Washington University, who co-authored the research published in the journal Cell Metabolism, said: 'I'm very excited to see these results because the effect of NMN is much bigger than other known compounds or chemicals. 'Plus, the fact that the body naturally makes NMN is promising for translating these findings into humans.' In older mice, around 15 per cent of healthy males fed a normal diet also developed diabetes. Glucose response improved in these animals after just one injection of NMN. The same treatment had no adverse effects on older mice not suffering from diabetes. Few elderly female mice developed the disease unless they were switched to a high-fat diet. 'Again, when we injected these females with NMN, we came up with a completely normal glucose tolerance curve,' said Dr Kathryn Mills, another member of the Washington University team. 'We can also see that the NMN has completely reversed and normalised the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty acids.' People with a good supply of vitamin D have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, a study has found. Researchers at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, in Germany, said the vitamin could have an anti-inflammatory effect. Study author Dr Barbara Thorand, said: 'In the winter months people often do no receive adequate supplies of the vitamin because of a lack of sunlight. 'If follow-up studies confirm out results, a targeted improvement in the supply of vitamin D to the public could also reduce the risk of developing diabetes.' Oily fish, eggs and milk products all contain vitamin D. The results will be published in the journal Diabetes Care.",

        "article": "By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 02:57 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:32 EST, 28 May 2012 . A young woman who was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria while on a zip line has spoken her first words since her fingers and foot amputated. Aimee Copeland's father Andy, who has kept a blog on her progress since she became ill, wrote online: 'Today\u2026 May 27\u2026 is AIMEE DAY!!! Today Aimee has finally spoken her first words. I will follow with details tonight.' The University of West Georgia graduate developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg when she fell from a homemade zip line over a river on May 1. Thrilled: Aimee, left with mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige, has delighted her family by speaking for the first time since her shocking extreme surgery . She had to have most of her left leg, hands and right foot amputated at Augusta Hospital, Georgia, and doctors thought she had only a slim chance of surviving the aggressive infection. She had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her. Miss Copeland has improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up for his brave daughter. She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read. Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. In silence: Miss Copeland had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her . Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a fortnight ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite several major operations. Now she has spoken for the first time, although she is likely to remain in hospital for several months. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed. A week ago, Mr Copeland revealed that his daughter was breathing on her own, as she was taken off her ventilator for several hours. She surprised doctors by sitting for five hours on Tuesday, after nurses thought she would only be able to sit up for an hour. Aimee 'is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?' he wrote on his blog. Miss Copeland's amazing recovery has brought support from all over the world and her father had said how grateful he is for the outpouring of concern from across the world. 'The level of prayer and support has been phenomenal and we intend to read every card and send thank you cards for every gift,' he wrote after she began breathing independently. Stoic: Aimee Copeland has now been removed from a ventilator at the Georgia hospital after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . 'Aimee is being Aimee. She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours.' When Miss Copeland learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on May 19, she responded by saying: 'Let's do this.' Mr Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after she contracted the condition. He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote. He said he was finally able to tell his daughter after she began communicating what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world. 'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.' Difficult times: Miss Copeland was only given a small chance of survival as she battled the infection . Distraught: Paige Copeland, centre, cried as her parents Donna and Andy spoke about Aimee after she had her leg amputated . He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened and her jaw dropped. Then, Mr Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face. 'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote. He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said. 'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote. 'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - \"Let's do this\".' Doctors had hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counsellor was available to help Miss Copeland once she was informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Dr Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Miss Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.",

        "article": "By . Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 7 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:55 EST, 8 January 2013 . Her dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them; her hairstyle is copied in salons across the country. But all those seeking to emulate the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s style no longer have to pore over photographs. They can simply consult Vogue\u2019s complete guide to Kate. From the diameter of her curls to the number of teeth she shows when she smiles, nothing has escaped the fashion bible\u2019s scrutiny. Ahead of her 31st birthday tomorrow, the magazine has analysed outfits the duchess has worn since her marriage to Prince William in April 2011, plus a handful from before the couple\u2019s engagement \u2013 100 in total. So to be a true copy Kate, you should wear blue, ensure the average drop of your earrings is 33mm \u2013 and carry your clutch bag with both hands. According to the guide, when it comes to her clothes, Kate\u2019s favourite colour appears to be blue, which she has worn on 24 per cent of occasions. From peacock to Prussian, it is her out and out favourite. She also favours red (13 per cent) - which she wore for the occasion of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Pageant - followed by white (12 per cent) and, less popularly with the public, grey (11 per cent). Next on the list is purple (9 per cent), multi coloured or patterned outfits (eight per cent) pink ( seven per cent) and green ( six per cent). Cream and yellow both languish at the bottom of the league table on five per cent. By far and away most outfits worn on her last 100 official engagements come from top end High Street store LK Bennett - worn on 28 public engagements. But designer Alexander McQueen, whose outfits cost several thousand pounds apiece and who the Duchess chose to design her wedding dress, is her next favourite label with 14. Other designers in Kate\u2019s top five are Jenny Packham (six), who has designed some of her most stunning evening dresses, and Temperley (eight). Once the high street Queen, Zara languishes at seven (probably because the firm have a huge store just a short hop from her home at Kensington Palace). But surprisingly Reiss, the label Kate wore to meet US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle at Buckingham Palace, does not even register. Vogue have even made it their business to scrutinise the length of the Duchess\u2019s sleeves - finding that 6:1 being the most commonly seen arm-to-sleeve-length ratio. \u2018All the better to display the royal wrist-bling,\u2019 it says. The magazine estimates that on her most recent tour of South East Asia and the Pacific, the Duchess took along 61 items of clothing, footwear and accessories worth around \u00a31,427 per outfit (compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales whose tour outfits costs the modern equivalent of \u00a34,270 a pop). Kate\u2019s other most talked-about asset is her glorious tumbling tresses and the magazine has even, unbelievably, worked out the average diameter of her curls - 25mm. The Duchess goes for a glossy \u2018Chelsea blow dry\u2019 73.4 of the time - a perfectly achievable goal if one, like Kate, has a hairdresser on call 24 hours a day. Just like on her wedding day, she favours a chic half-up half-down do 13.6 per cent of the time, wearing it either naturally loose and curly or in a ponytail 6.5 per cent of occasions. Her accessories are equally closely monitored. Apparently the Duchess has perfected the tilt of her hats and fascinators - always to the right at a stylish 50 degree angle - to show off her enviable cheekbones. The average dimension of her favourite clutch bags is 194mm by 132 mm and she carried them as thus: one handed 31 per cent, left hand over right 15.5 per cent, right hand over left 5.5 per cent, hands together 48 per cent. Her favoured shoe designer is the upmarket Stuart Weitzman - sported on 13 public engagements out of the last 100 - closely followed by Jimmy Choo (well you would do, wouldn\u2019t you?) at nine official events. The analysis found Kate favoured the colour blue, having been seen wearing it on 24 per cent of occasions, while green dresses only made it to six per cent . Even her earrings do not escape scrutiny - the average drop measuring exactly 33 mm. One of her favourites pairs is a glittering sapphire and diamond set once owned by William\u2019s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who sported them on the cover of Vogue in July 1994. Seventeen years later, on her July 2011 official tour to Canada, Kate wore them in public again after having them slightly remodelled. Creams and yellow languish at the bottom of the table at five per cent, according to the study, which analysed everything including the length of her sleeves . Even her teeth do not escape the eagle eye of the fashionistas. Apparently the Duchess, who is believed to have had her teeth whitened and straightened by \u2018micro-rotation\u2019 - using invisible braces attached to the back of each tooth - shows an average of 8.6 teeth when she smiles. The February issue of Vogue is on sale from Thursday. The Duchess has developed into a fashion icon, as dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them and salons across the country are asked to emulate her hairstyle as analysed by Vogue- on sale Thursday .",

        "article": "Veteran CBS news correspondent Steve Kroft\u00a0enjoyed a string of hotel liaisons and exchanged raunchy texts with a New York City lawyer during a three-year affair, according to reports. The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Harvard-educated  Lisan Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, according to the National Enquirer. The magazine claimed that, while Goines called off the relationship because Kroft was becoming too selfish, they were spotted out together on December 17 - just blocks from the Upper West Side home he shares with his wife, Jennet Conant, author of 'A Covert Affair'. The Enquirer, which also printed photos of Goines, 41, and Kroft, 69, together in the street, noted that they were seen kissing in the back of a cab before they spent the night at five-star hotel. Scroll down for video . 'Serious lapse in judgment': CBS correspondent Steve Kroft, pictured left with his wife, journalist and author Jennet Conant, has admitted to having an affair with New York lawyer Lisan Goines, pictured right . When confronted with the report by the New York Post, Kroft admitted to the relationship, calling it 'a serious lapse of personal judgment' that had hurt his wife and family. 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he said. The affair reportedly started in 2011 when Kroft spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the bar at the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, \"I have to see you again\",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. In another message, he told her:\u00a0'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly resonded: \u00a0'U all over and deep inside of me,' she reportedly responded. Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award. He told the New York Post that his\u00a0'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist. Watch full interview on CBS .",

        "article": "By . Emily Davies . PUBLISHED: . 03:54 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:44 EST, 11 April 2013 . A lesbian businesswoman is helping homosexual learner drivers dodge old-school driving instructors by opening Britain's first \u2018gay driving school.\u2019 Karis Smith, 27, started Gay Driving School Manchester after friends complained about jokes being made by instructors about their sexuality when having lessons. She said stories of instructors referring to pupils as \u2018faggots\u2019 or grilling transgender youngsters on whether they are a boy or a girl had left her horrified. Karis Smith, who works as a driving instructor for the AA, runs 'The Gay Driving School', aimed at making the experience of learning to drive easier for the LGBT community . And she said some gay leaner drivers pretended to be heterosexual because they felt uncomfortable revealing their homosexuality to a stranger. Now Miss Smith's solo business is creating a stir amongst Manchester's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community with her promise to make pupils feel \u2018comfortable\u2019 over their sexuality when behind the wheel of her Ford Focus. On her website Miss Smith says: \u2018Gay? Lesbian? Bisexual? TG/TS/TV? Looking for driving lessons with a friendly driving instructor in a comfortable learning environment? Then look no further! I am a young, female, gay driving instructor. \u2018Learning to drive can be a daunting experience enough, without worrying about getting on with your instructor. \u2018You will learn much better if you are relaxed, comfortable and most importantly yourself! I am fully committed to teaching you to be a safe, conscientious driver whilst achieving that all important pink driving license!\u2019 Today Miss Smith, from Fallowfield, Manchester said: \u2018The response I've had so far has been very positive. The gay friendly service was launched in response to complaints to members of the LGBT community that other instructors had made them feel uncomfortable . \u2018I have heard a lot of horror stories about people's experiences with driving instructors, where they have had to explain their sexuality. \u2018There have even been stories about transgender learners who have had to put up with jokes about their gender or questions about their looks. \u2018As a pupil you'll spend 40 to 50 hours learning to drive in very close proximity to a total stranger. \u2018Part of feeling at ease during your lessons is building a good rapport with your instructor - this is much easier when you can just be yourself. \u2018A lot of gay people told me that they had strange experiences and it quickly became apparent that many of them said they'd never felt that comfortable with their instructors. \u2018I've had a pupil come to me halfway through her training as her previous instructor shared many of his far-right political beliefs and extreme views on race, immigration and sexuality during conversations in the lessons that made her very uncomfortable. \u2018I don't think we should live in a world where all LGBT people should only use services from other LGBT providers - but I do think it's important for people to have that option should they wish. \u2018With this venture there is no need to explain yourself and its a lot more relaxed. You won't be met with a barrage of questions about your personal life. Karis Smith's website offers a 'comfortable learning environment' for people who are gay, bisexual, transgender, transexual or transvestite . \u2018I think the people who have appreciated it the most are those who are transgender. Getting behind the wheel for the first time is daunting enough without having to worry about how a driving instructor will treat you.\u2019 The driving school, which is gay friendly and not gay only, is set up as an AA franchise and Karis said the fact that the Ford Focus car she uses looks discreet is a positive factor for pupils. The former Manchester University student said all of her pupils, more than 50 so far, have passed their driving tests in three attempts or less. Some of the complaints made to Karis were issues such as constantly having to use \u2018non-gender\u2019 pronouns when chatting with their instructor, mentioning their 'partner' rather than girlfriend or boyfriend. Another complaint was having to lie about what they did for a living rather than admitting they worked in a bar in Manchester's Canal Street gay district. Sarah McNally, from the Lesbian and Gay Foundation Manchester, said: \u2018Unfortunately some people still face discrimination and homophobia in society today, so you should be able to feel more comfortable accessing LGBT specific spaces or services.\u2019",

What's more, Deadline reports that 300,000 of these downloads come from a video sharing platform in China where the film will not be released. China is also the biggest ally of North Korea, who many, including the FBI and President Obama, believe was behind the hacking of Sony in an attempt to stop the release of this film. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un denied this claim, and just this week numerous cybersecurity experts have stated they too do not feel the country was responsible, noting that it was most likely an inside job.",

        "summary": "NEW: The sexual abuse trial for a Philadelphia priest and a parochial teacher has been postponed .\nThe trial had been scheduled to start Tuesday .\nBoth men are accused of raping an altar boy more than a decade ago .\nThe alleged victim will be the key witness .",
        "article": "Philadelphia (CNN) -- A judge has postponed the trial of a Philadelphia Catholic priest and a parochial school teacher, both accused of raping the same altar boy in separate incidents. The trial, scheduled to start Tuesday, was postponed due to a family emergency for a defense attorney. A new trial date could be set by the end of the week. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, and Bernard Shero, a teacher at the parish's school, have been charged with rape, indecent sexual assault and other criminal charges in the alleged assaults that occurred more than a decade ago. The accuser, dubbed \"Billy\" in a 2011 Philadelphia grand jury report, will be the key witness against the men, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The former altar boy, now in his 20s, testified earlier this year during the landmark trial of two Philadelphia priests charged with child sexual abuse and conspiracy. It marked the first time a Catholic church leader -- in this case, Monsignor William Lynn -- has been convicted for covering up the crimes of offending priests. Billy reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt, Shero and another priest, Edward Avery. A grand jury determined his allegations had merit, and the priests were subsequently charged and arrested. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in the grand jury report. According to the grand jury's report, Engelhardt allegedly showed Billy pornographic magazines before having him engage in oral intercourse in the sacristy, the room inside the church where a priest prepares for Mass. The alleged incident happened in 1998 when Billy was 10. The following school year, Shero, the boy's sixth-grade teacher at St. Jerome School, is accused of sodomizing the then 11-year-old, according to the grand jury report. Shero allegedly offered the boy a ride home and then stopped at a park. He told the boy they were \"going to have fun,\" took off his clothes, allegedly raped the boy, then made him walk the rest of the way home, the grand jury report stated. In April, Billy testified at the trial of Lynn, the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for shuffling predator priests from parish to parish, and the Rev. James Brennan, who was accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old altar boy. Lynn, 61, was found guilty in June of one count of child endangerment and later sentenced to three to six years in prison. The jury was unable to bring a verdict against Brennan, who is scheduled to be retried next year before a new judge. Avery, who had been scheduled to be on trial with Lynn and Brennan, pleaded guilty after admitting he sexually assaulted Billy when he was 10, and was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years. In his April testimony, Billy detailed the alleged abuse at the hands of Avery when he was in the fifth grade. He also testified that the sexual assault led to a life of substance abuse, a suicide attempt and a criminal history including drug possession. He said he did not tell anyone about the abuse until 2009, after a group therapy session for his drug use. When asked why he didn't speak out earlier, Billy said he was \"too scared.\" \"I thought that I would get into trouble and that no one would believe me,\" he told jurors in April. \"I thought I did something wrong, and, he's a priest.\" Priests, particularly those in high-ranking positions, have an exceptional amount of power within the Catholic Church, especially in Philadelphia because of the church's deep roots in the community. With nearly 1.5 million members, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is one of the largest in the nation. A new archbishop has been installed to help turn around the scandal-plagued archdiocese.

        "article": "A bizarre cloud over parts of Victoria caused a flurry of concern and awe on social media as witnesses labelled the formation the 'rapture cloud'. The rare cloud, known as a Fallstreak Hole, appeared over the Wonthaggi, in the Gippsland area of Victoria on Monday, flecked with colour and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky. Social media users flocked to the web to speculate what the cloud was, with some claiming that it was a 'rapture' cloud. Scroll down for video . The rare cloud, known as a Fallstreak Hole, appeared over the Wonthaggi, in the Gippsland area of Victoria on Monday, flecked with colour and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky . Ben Stewart was with his family on Phillip Island when they spotted the unusual cloud formation in the sky . On Twitter user said, 'Rapture's here, folks. Some weird rainbow/ cloud action going on in Wonthaggi right now'. Another asked, 'What's going on over Wongthaggi?' According to\u00a0Science Magazine, the holes can be caused by a phenomena called 'seeding', when planes fly though clouds causing ice particles to freeze in the air as it flows around the aircraft. Ben Stewart was with his family on Phillip Island when they spotted the unusual cloud formation in the sky. 'We just looked up and there was this thing that looked like something out of Independence Day,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The IT consultant from Melbourne said that they stood staring at the sky for a while, trying to figure out what it was. 'Other people spotted it as well, and most of the theories as to what caused it had to do with an aircraft or helicopter, definitely man made,' he said. 'One of my friends did say in jest that it was the rapture. It definitely looked out of place in the sky.' 'I guess now we're all just waiting for the mothership to come.' Mr Stewart said that he often saw unusual weather patterns as he grew up in northern Victoria, but that this was one of the more bizarre. 'It was a perfectly sunny day, and quite warm, so it just seemed to come out of nowhere,' he said. Michael Efron from the Bureau of Meteorology's duty forecaster, said that the cloud could also be called a punch hole cloud. 'They form when the water temperature in the cloud is below freezing, but the water has not yet frozen due to a lack of ice nucleation particles,' Mr Efron told Fairfax Media. 'In this case, when the water does start to freeze, it falls down to the surface ... so you're left with this cloud surrounding it, this clear area.' The fallstreak hole is seen in the skies above Wonthaggi in southeastern Australia by dairy farmer Leesa Willmott, 47, on Sunday. On the right the rare cloud formation is seen with a rainbow streak running through it . The flecks of colour were called iridescence, and can also be found in other natural objects such as sea shells, soap bubbles and even butterfly wings. 'This type of [cloud] iridescence occurs with high level cloud and with diffraction, [meaning] that water droplets are gathering light,' Mr Efron said. There have been other recent sightings of fallstreak hole clouds, with one forming over Perth in early October. A spokesman from the Bureau of Meteorology told Perth Now\u00a0that 'It doesn\u2019t occur often so it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s causing quite a stir'. In May the same type of cloud formed over Northern California, sparking debates of UFO's and conspiracies. 'So the @WhiteHouse wants you to believe what happened over the skies of Stockton yesterday was a \"cloud formation\" ? GTFOH #iKnowWhatiSaw,' tweeted one user. Others pointed to government controlled weather manipulation and wormholes for the cloud's unusual appearance.",

Five fire engines arrived at the scene to tackle the blaze, including a turntable ladder to extinguish the flames which had engulfed the roof and first floor. Fire ravages through a cottage in South Molton, North Devon, immediately after it was struck by lightning . The British Red Cross Fire and Emergency Support Services team also attended along with teams from Western Power, the Environment Agency and South West Water.

David Bartlett, of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue, said: 'The building was struck by lightning which caused a fire in the roof space. 'It is not common for a fire to break out after a house being struck by lightning - it was unlucky it took hold and ignited something flammable.'

        "article": "I once wondered why we indigenous peoples of North America must break it down when it comes to why something is anti-Native American. On the whole, people can recognize what's anti-black, anti-gay, anti-Latino, anti-Asian, and so on: But when it comes to racism directed at Native Americans, we, the first peoples of this continent, are left having to explain why Indian mascots and painting your face red at a Cleveland Indians game denigrate us. Years of studying and observing this situation have led me to an unfortunate conclusion: People have been conditioned to ignore racism directed at Native Americans. But, I'm not sure I can consciously blame them ... at least not all of them. Think about it: Thanks to Hollywood, I'm supposed to have long hair, bronze skin and a very limited vocabulary. Courtesy of Thanksgiving and Halloween, it's possible someone might believe it's \"just in good fun\" to dress in faux Native American garb and play Indian. So when I walk in a room, nobody looks at me and sees a Native American. Why? Because people have been conditioned to believe I look, act, and even talk a certain way, and believe playing Indian is OK. Lo, it's not. So here's the solution: We are going to be seen. As social media and the web continue to grow exponentially, so too do the voice and face of Native America. The National Congress of American Indians has just launched yet another campaign to put our faces and those of our allies in the public eye. NCAI's hashtag, #ProudToBe, is a video and photo campaign that uses the web and demonstrates that we are more than a costume. We are more than a mascot. In fact, the second half of the campaign against the dehumanization of Native Americans in the form of sports mascots is aptly called \"#NotYourMascot.\" And many of this nation's leaders have joined in the growing chorus of conscientious objectors who see Indian mascots for what they are: racist. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Sen. Maria Cantwell, and Washington, D.C., Councilman David Grosso have each been photographed holding signs that read \"#ProudToBe Standing With #NotYourMascot.\" And, according to the folks at the National Congress of American Indians, more photos continue to stream in. Grosso, who's a Washington Redskins season ticket holder, recently told me he predicts the team name will, in fact, be abolished in the next five years. \"Ultimately we're going to have to right this wrong,\" he said. \"The word 'redskins' has never been used in a positive way. It's been a racist and a derogatory term since forever.\" Sen. Reid told me: \"The degrading team name inflicts pain on Native American populations. The name is going to change; it's only a question of when. The NFL and Dan Snyder have to realize they are on the losing side of history.\" Opinion: NFL may throw flag on N-word, but what about the 'R-word'? Several days ago, I was asked: \"Why are you picking on the Redskins? What about the Cleveland Indians or the Atlanta Braves?\" First, the term \"redskins\" is a pejorative, a racial slur. We are told by our elders that the eastern Algonquian word for woman is shunksqaw, and that \"squaw\" in the English usage came to signify that part of the woman the settlers wanted during negotiations. It's a pejorative. It always has been, just like the word \"redskins.\" The term \"Indian\" isn't a racial slur, even though it's incorrect; and neither are the terms \"brave\" or \"warrior.\" But that's missing the point. When the status of a Native American is demoted to that of a caricature, we are objectified and diminished as a people. We become entertainment, not fellow citizens. How are you supposed to take me seriously if all you see is the stereotypical image of the Hollywood or sports mascot Indian? Courtesy of the Web, we are no longer out of sight. We are no longer canceled out of the American conversation. Also, more Native Americans live in urban settings than ever before. More than 70% of us work, live and thrive in big cities. Native Americans on reservations have smartphones and laptops, so geographic isolation is slowly becoming a thing of the past as well. And we use these new technologies to speak out against the macro- and micro-aggressions directed at Native Americans. Today, we are lawyers, doctors, teachers, business owners, professional athletes, artists, and maybe your neighbor next door. We are proud to be Din\u00e9, Lakota, Choctaw, Crow, Cherokee, Ojibwe, Cheyenne, Navajo, Zuni, and many more. And so the momentum builds against the racism aimed at us, leaving the question: Will you tell your children or grandchildren you are on the side of the Native American and allies who believe we deserve the same respect afforded to others? Or will you tell them we were just a group of politically correct Indians and Indian-lovers who were infringing on other people's privilege? Right. The Redskins fan, the Indians fan, the Braves fan -- they're upset because they demand said privilege. We're upset because we demand respect.",

The last king to sit on it was poisoned at his own wedding, so it was perhaps no surprise that the Queen preferred not to take the Iron Throne when she visited the Game of Thrones set. Instead, the monarch inspected the seat, which is made from interlaced iron swords, from a safe distance before getting a closer look at the royal treasury of Westeros, laid out beside it. She was, however, happy to hold a tiny replica and beamed as she met cast members, among them Kit Harington who plays Jon Snow, Lena Headey who\u00a0 plays Queen Cersei Lannister and Sophie Turner who plays Sansa Stark.

The Queen looks less than impressed as she examines the throne, watched by Game of Thrones star Lena Headey . The set, which is in Belfast's recently completed Titanic Quarter, is where many of the scenes inside King's Landing - the royal palace of Westeros - are filmed. Home to the wicked queen Cersei Lannister, King's Landing was the scene of several Machiavellian plots and scores of unpleasant murders, among them that of the 'Mad King' Aerys II Targaryen who was stabbed in the back by Cersei's brother, Jaime. Luckily for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, the cast were on their best behaviour and chatted politely with the royal couple as they showed them around the set. Maisie Williams, the 17-year-old star who plays the spirited Arya Stark, was the first of the actors to chat to the monarch. 'She kept commenting on how uncomfortable the throne looked, that was funny,' she said. Looks uncomfortable! Buckingham Palace refused to say whether the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh watch Game of Thrones . Curious? The Queen steps a little closer to the throne which according to Westeros legend, is made from more than 1000 swords - is she tempted to take a seat? One is amused!

The HBO drama, which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by George R. R Martin, is thought to be loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, which saw two opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of England. With York on one side and Lancaster on . the other, England was convulsed by a series of battles, dastardly plots . and pretenders lurking on the other side of the Channel until, with the . death of Richard III, Lancaster finally triumphed. The Queen, who also holds the title and . the lands of the Duchy of Lancaster, had earlier been given a snapshot . into the UK's more recent bloody past, visiting the infamous Crumlin .

The Queen's visit to the Game of Thrones set was one of a series of engagements scheduled in and around Belfast today. After a lunch at Belfast City Hall with local dignitaries, the monarch visited the lovely St George's covered market, where she chatted to stallholders and met well-wishers. She also became the latest victim of an unscheduled royal selfie, as an eager young fan tried to snap a photo with her on his iPhone - much to the consternation of the Queen's security detail.

Over two years this would amount to 7.4 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions - the equivalent of consuming 17 barrels of oil, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. But Mr Husting defended the arrangement and said he would rather not take the journey but it was necessary because the alternative is a twelve hour round trip by train.

The U.S. ski team said Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, died in the incident near the Rettenbach glacier near Soelden, the venue for the annual season-opening World Cup races. Berlack, from Franconia, New Hampshire, and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers who were descending from the 3,056-meter Gaislachkogel when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four skied out of the slide and escaped unhurt. Scroll down for video . Avalanche: Ronnie Berlack, left, was from New Hampshire and has died aged 20. Bryce Astle, 19, was from Utah . Young: Berlack, 20, stopped skiing in early 2014 because of a knee injury, but returned to racing over the summer . Promising: Astle was the top-performing junior skier at the\u00a0U.S. Alpine Championships in Squaw Valley last March . Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures. U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President and CEO Tiger Shaw said:\u00a0'Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport \u2014 both on the race course and skiing the mountain. 'Our hearts go out to the Berlack and Astle families, as well as to their extended sport family. Both of them loved what they did and conveyed that to those around them.' Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers following two top-20 finishes at the 2013 U.S. national championships and a spring tryout camp. According to a ski team profile he came 11th in downhill and 17th in the 'super G' slalom race. Off-piste: The two athletes, along with four others, were skiing off of marked trails on the Rettenback glacier, shown above in early winter, when the avalanche struck . The deaths took place after an avalanche on the Rettenbach glacier (marked above) in the Tyrol area of Austria, near its borders with Italy and Switzerland . He injured his knee in January 2014, but competed through the summer and raced in Chile and Canada before heading to Europe. He was off to a strong season last year before suffering a knee injury last January. He had come back, competing in South American Cup races in Chile this summer and in NorAm and FIS races last month in Canada. Astle was invited to train with the development team this season after strong early season results, including two top-10 results last month in Canada. In a championship race at Squaw Valley, California, he came 13th in the giant slalom and was the top-performing junior racer. At the NorAm Cup in Canada last month he finished on the podium in all but two events, ski officials said.

'We are all very close,' said Riml, an Austrian who was born and grew up in Soelden. 'We train a lot in Park City. We'll see how they handle the whole thing and how they react.' Riml added 'it's a shock for everybody. Two great boys, great athletes, good skiers. They were fun to have around. We are all in shock, still. It's very tragic.' Berlack and Astle were part of a group of 10 skiers on the development team who gained experience in the Europa Cup and were preparing to race on the top-level World Cup. 'They all have the potential (to be on the World Cup),' Riml said. 'These two boys were among the other eight boys who are our future. We believed in these guys, that's why we selected them.' Soelden has been the European base for the U.S. ski team since 2011.",

        "article": "Chancellor George Osborne was today forced to defend a Conservative party advert aimed at working class voters, claiming 'they' enjoy bingo and cheap beer. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps . took to Twitter last night to launch an advert devised by Tory HQ to . highlight Budget measures supposedly aimed at \u2018hardworking people\u2019. But it has been widely mocked online, and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets, clogs, eating swans, shooting poor people and suggesting the Tories think it is still 1961. Scroll down for video . 'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget . Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband . The . advert read: \u2018Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more . of the things they enjoy.\u2019 Mr Shapps urged Conservative supporters to \u2018spread the word\u2019. After waves of criticism and ridicule, a Tory source insisted: 'We stand by the advert.' But the Lib Dems accused their coalition partners of being 'patronising', Labour said it was \u2018condescending\u2019 and the writers of political comedy The Thick Of It said they would have rejected it from a script for being 'too far-fetched'. In a round of media interviews this morning Mr Osborne was repeatedly asked to defend the advert, distracting from his key announcements on help for savers and pensioners. Tory Chairman Grant Shapps, who tweeted the advert this afternoon after the Budget announcement . In yesterday's Budget Mr Osborne took . 1p off the price of a pint of beer and dramatically halved duty paid on . bingo from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. Both measures were seen as part of carefully crafted pitch to win over the skilled manual workers who backed Margaret Thatcher in their droves. But . the row over the advert - in particular the use of the word 'they' to . refer to people who like beer and bingo - has overshadowed the message . about help for bingo halls and pubs. 'These are important Budget measures, they are not the only Budget measures,' Mr Osborne told the BBC. 'This whole story... was whipped up by a Labour Party that didn\u2019t have anything else to say about the economy. 'We . are communicating what\u2019s in the Budget. The more people hear about the . Budget the more confident people can be that they are on the right . track.' But his Lib Dem deputy at the Treasury, Danny Alexander, made clear his unease at the ad from his coalition partners. He it was 'rather patronising' and 'demeans some quite sensible things' in the Budget. 'There . are good reasons to be supporting Bingo, there are good reasons to be . encouraging our pub sector to be stronger - that\u2019s the analysis behind . those measures,' he told BBC 2\u2019s Newsnight programme. 'This language, well that\u2019s for Grant Shapps to justify.' Nick Clegg said Grant Shapps\u2019 tweet of a Tory poster was \u201csilly\u201d, but should not detract from a strong Budget. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because actually the issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious, including, by the way, giving support to the bingo industry \u2013 an important industry \u2013 giving support to our pubs and so on.' Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in on LBC, Mr Clegg added: 'There were just much bigger things at stake in the Budget as well, namely how are over 24million people going to benefit, which they will now do with an additional \u00a3100 tax cut. 'The very important package we\u2019ve been working on for weeks to help savers... because people who save, first, should be trusted more with how they manage their own money, their own savings; but secondly, after years and years of low interest rates, we need to make sure as the recovery starts taking root that savers who haven\u2019t really benefitted from that stand to do so from now on.' Stewart Wood, a senior aide to Labour leader Ed Miliband, described the advert as \u2018ill-conceived\u2019 and \u2018condescending\u2019. He said: \u2018Of all the ill-conceived aspects of this Tory ad, it\u2019s the condescending use of the word \u201cthey\u201d that grates the most.\u2019 Stephen Tall, editor of the grassroots . Liberal Democrat website LibDem Voice, described the ad as an . \u2018embarrassment\u2019, and said it \u2018goes back to the 1950s\u2019. Some Twitter users suggested the advert must be a spoof. Others . said it reminded them of Pulp\u2019s hit record \u2018Common People\u2019 which mocked . the futile attempts of a rich student to understand the struggle faced . by working class people. Spoof versions of the advert were circulating on the Internet within minutes of its release by Mr Shapps. One said: \u2018Cut the bingo tax and beer duty. That\u2019s what you wretched proles get up to, isn\u2019t it? 'So put on your clogs and grab your whippets and have at it\u2019. But . some Tories were dismayed at the advert. One said: \u2018Why are we talking . about beer and bingo, not cuts in income tax? We just look like we\u2019re . talking down to people.\u2019 Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire . Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander last night distanced himself from the Tory advert. He told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u2018I thought it was a spoof at first. It may be our budget, but it\u2019s their words. It\u2019s pretty patronising.\u2019 Labour\u2019s shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie described the advert as \u2018quite astonishing\u2019. \u2018What better demonstration do you need that they are out of touch?\u2019 The . overwhelmingly negative reaction to the advert is a major embarrassment . for Mr Shapps, a grammar school boy who prides himself on his . understanding of ordinary voters. Mr Shapps has made it a major priority for the Tories to increase their effectiveness on social media, such as Twitter. He is now likely to face questions about who designed the advert and why he agreed to sign it off. It is also embarrassing for David Cameron, who is sensitive to charges that he is part of an out-of-touch metropolitan elite. A major poll conducted by former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft last month found that the most common description of the Prime Minister by voters was \u2018out of touch\u2019. Mr Cameron has also faced discomfort over his reliance on fellow Old Etonians within his inner circle.Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked anger in Number 10 last week by describing the number of Old Etonians at the heart of Government as \u2018preposterous\u2019. In 2012, Andrew Mitchell, then chief whip, was . involved in a heated row with another police officer, Toby Rowland, . after he was refused permission to cycle through the main gate of . Downing Street. Mr Mitchell, accused of calling the officer a \u2018pleb\u2019, was forced to resign his post after a month of intense media interest. Two police officers were sacked over the so-called \u2018Plebgate\u2019. One, Keith Wallis, was jailed for a year at the Old Bailey for misconduct in a public office.",

        "summary": "George R.R. Martin explains why Robb had to die .\nHe said reactions have been both positive and negative .\nMartin said it was the hardest scene he ever had to write .",
        "article": "(EW.com) -- Millions of \"Game of Thrones\" fans are feeling sadness, outrage, and, sure, some perverse excitement after watching Sunday's episode titled \"The Rains of Castamere.\" But for Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, such reactions to \"The Red Wedding\" are nothing new. Martin has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous Tully-Frey union for more than a decade, ever since he published his Song of Ice and Fire saga's third novel, A Storm of Swords. Below, the author reveals why Robb had to die, gives his reaction to upset readers and spills the scene's horrifying real-life inspiration. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How early in the process of writing the book series did you know you were gonna kill off Robb and Catelyn? George R.R. Martin: I knew it almost from the beginning. Not the first day, but very soon. I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do. Since Song of Ice and Fire so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures, should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending? As The Boy recently said on Thrones, \"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.\" I've stated numerous times that I anticipate a bittersweet ending. EW: What sort of reactions have you received from readers over the years about the scene? Extreme. Both positive and negative. That was the hardest scene I've ever had to write. It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it. So the entire book was done and there was still that one chapter left. Then I wrote it. It was like murdering two of your children. I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book. Just as you grieve if a friend is killed, you should grieve if a fictional character is killed. You should care. If somebody dies and you just go get more popcorn, it's a superficial experience isn't it? EW: Why do you think it has such a powerful reaction? Robb wasn't one of your \"viewpoint characters\" in the books and Catelyn wasn't really a beloved personality. [Long pause] That's an interesting question. I don't know if I have a good answer. Maybe the way I did it. There's a certain amount of foreboding leading up to it. It's a betrayal. It comes out of left field. It's at a wedding feast. Robb has made his peace and you think the worst is over. Then it comes out of nowhere. There's also secondary characters killed. Then outside hundreds of Stark people are killed. It's not just two people. To me, that Robb and Catelyn are family makes it worse. And Catelyn has suffered so much and lost so many people around her, and she actually thinks she's lost more than she really has (since she doesn't know for sure that Arya, Bran and Rickon are alive). Then this happens. She also has the moment there to plead. There's also her murdering the hostage. He's not a son that Frey particularly values.* So in the end her bluff is empty. And she does. She carries through. There's a certain power to that too. EW: I'm pretty sure I know the answer to this, but: Have you ever regretted the scene? Martin: No. Not as a writer. It's probably the most powerful scene in the books. It cost me some readers, but gained me many more. It's going to be hard for me to watch it [on the show]. It's going to be a tough night. Because I love these characters too. And in a TV show you get to know the actors. You're also ending that relationship with an actor that you have affection for. Richard Madden and Michelle Fairley have done an amazing job. EW: What do you say to readers who are upset about the scene? It depends on what they say. What can you say to someone who says they'll never read your book again? People read books for different reasons. I respect that. Some read for comfort. And some of my former readers have said their life is hard, their mother is sick, their dog died, and they read fiction to escape. They don't want to get hit in the mouth with something horrible. And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair. We all want that at times. There's a certain vicarious release to that. So I'm not dismissive of people who want that. But that's not the kind of fiction I write, in most cases. It's certainly not what Ice and Fire is. It tries to be more realistic about what life is. It has joy, but it also had pain and fear. I think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness. One of my favorite elements of the scene is you introduce this idea of \"salt and bread.\" We accept that as readers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Okay, in this fantasy world, people don't harm each other once they eat a host's bread and salt in their home. Then you break your own rule. It's like you're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \"Of course they're not going to follow that silly rule ALL the time!\" It was stolen from history. Hospitality laws were real in Dark Ages society. A host and guest were not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies. By violating that law, the phrase is, they \"condemn themselves for all time.\" EW: What about the Red Wedding itself? Is that based on history too? The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history. One was a case called The Black Dinner. The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan. He reached out to make peace. He offered the young Earl of Douglas safe passage. He came to Edinburgh Castle and had a great feast. Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum. They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the symbol of death. And as soon as he saw it, he knew what it meant. They dragged them out and put them to death in the courtyard. The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre. Clan MacDonald stayed with the Campbell clan overnight and the laws of hospitality supposedly applied. But the Campbells arose and started butchering every MacDonald they could get their hands on. No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse. * Changed to one of Frey's young wives in TV version . See the original story at EW.com.

        "summary": "NEW: A conservative leader accuses Gov. Tom Corbett of \"abandoning marriage\"\nCorbett says he believes marriage should be between one man, one woman .\nStill, he decides against fighting a decision striking state's same-sex marriage ban .\n\"The case is extremely unlikely to succeed on appeal,\" Corbett says .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- Going against his personal views, Pennsylvania's governor won't challenge a federal judge's ruling striking his state's same-sex marriage ban, paving the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry there. Gov. Tom Corbett announced his decision in a statement Wednesday, a day after U.S. District Judge John E. Jones became the latest federal judge to declare a state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional. Pennsylvania officials will \"follow ... the provisions of Judge Jones' order with respect for all parties,\" the governor said. State Attorney General Kathleen Kane has also announced that she will not defend Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban because of what she believes is \"the unconstitutionality of this law.\" That means that while other entities could file appeals of their own, they are unlikely to have legal standing and therefore affect what happens in Pennsylvania. Corbett -- a Republican who just won his party's primary in pursuit of a re-election bid and, as he points out, a Roman Catholic -- said in his statement Wednesday that he still personally believes \"that marriage is between one man and one woman.\" His decision not to stand by that belief in court comes after \"a judgment as to the likelihood of a successful appeal.\" \"Given the high legal threshold set forth by Judge Jones in this case, the case is extremely unlikely to succeed on appeal,\" Corbett said. \"Therefore, after review of the opinion and on the advice of my Commonwealth legal team, I have decided not appeal.\" State-by-state: Developments on same-sex marriage . Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, slammed Corbett for opting \"to defend himself and his political aspirations\" rather than the traditional definition of marriage. \"Governor Corbett is abandoning marriage with this choice,\" Brown said on his organization's blog. \"He is also turning his back on the people of Pennsylvania and selling out his principles precisely when it is most necessary that he stand by them!\" Yet others applauded Corbett's decision. Those supportive voices include Jeff Cook-McCormac, a senior adviser with the American Unity Fund, a PAC dedicated to making a conservative case for \"the cause of freedom for gay and lesbian Americans.\" Cook-McCormac said Corbett \"did the right thing today, preventing a prolonged, divisive debate and providing much needed certainty for loving Pennsylvania families.\" \"Like Republican Governors Christie, Martinez and Sandoval before him, Governor Corbett recognizes there are thoughtful people with sincerely held beliefs on both sides of this issue and his decision allows his state to move forward and focus on the priorities citizens are concerned most about,\" Cook-McCormac added. Jones' decision was the latest in a wave of rulings against state prohibitions on same-sex marriage in the 11 months since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. That 5-4 opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, did not directly affect individual states' laws restricting marriage based on sexual orientation. But many federal judges have cited his decision on United States v. Windsor in their judgments, as well as the argument that same-sex marriage bans violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Most of these court rulings have been stayed -- meaning that, for now, marriage prohibitions remain in place -- until appeals courts, and possibly the Supreme Court, weigh in. Already, judges in the 10th Circuit out of Denver and 4th Circuit out of Richmond, Virginia, have heard appeals. All this movement in legal circles comes amid a significant shift in public opinion in recent years. Several states moved to allow gay and lesbian marriages last year on their own volition. A Gallup survey released Wednesday showed that 55% of respondents support laws granting same-sex couples equal rights to traditional marriages, the highest such number since Gallup began polling on this question in 1996.

Timelapse photography was used to capture the sticks movement, while a 'Matrix style' camera rig was set up around the drummer Ben Mead to capture his in 260 degrees. Scroll down to see the video . The team created a special 'time slice' camera rig which encircled the drummer to produce this stunning matrix-like effect of the drummer in mid flow .

'I've always wanted to see what rhythm might look like, to see the shape of sound,' he explained. The video is part of an ad for whisky firm Ballantine's. It developed special software to process the images captured and make the trails glow. Drummer Ben Mead used special sticks with lights fitted to create the amazing effects. The timelapse images were created for a commercial, along with a 'matrix' style scene which sees the camera moving around the drummer as he plays. 'In order to capture the stunning light trails, a bespoke application was developed C++ using the Cinder creative coding framework, taking a HD video feed from the main shoot camera and pulls out the LED-tipped drumsticks,' the firm explained.

Victim: Leanne McNuff was killed in March this year after her ex-boyfriend learned that she had an abortion, a court heard . A soldier preparing to serve in Afghanistan stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death after he hacked into her Facebook account to find she had aborted their unborn baby, a jury was told today. Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, kicked down the door to Leanne McNuff's home in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, before repeatedly knifing her, stamping on her face and leaving her to die on her landing floor on March 11 this year, a court heard. Miss McNuff's mother Margaret tried to save her daughter by stemming the flow of blood, but she died in hospital. Lowe, who was on bail at the time for . allegedly trying to throttle Miss McNuff while she was still pregnant, . had posted messages on Facebook shortly before the killing, the hearing . was told. One . read: 'Not even the army will help me out after all I have done for . Queen and country.' Another stated: 'Need a weapon out of armoury to . shoot the bitch'. Manchester Crown Court heard that the couple had been dating since 2006, but split up a month before the killing. After the break-up, Lowe warned Miss McNuff that he would 'make her life hell', the hearing was told. On . Valentine's Day, Miss McNuff learned that she was pregnant with Lowe's . baby and she rang him at his barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, where . he was serving in 1st Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment.

'The defendant responded saying, if . they could not live together as a family, his life wouldn\u2019t be worth . living and he would commit suicide.' Lowe was allowed home from base on compassionate grounds and, on arriving in Manchester, begged Miss McNuff to take him back. She agreed but said she 'wouldn\u2019t kiss or cuddle him' because she 'no longer had feelings for him'. The . court heard that, when the pair met at Miss McNuff's home to discuss . the pregnancy on February 18, a violent row broke out during which Lowe . called Miss McNuff a 'prostitute' and accused her of 'sleeping around'. As . Miss McNuff tried to force him out of the house, Lowe is said to have . grabbed her by the thoat and begun 'shaking her from side to side'. Scene: Police at the house in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, where Leanne McNuff's body was found .

'I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. I was scared wither he\u2019d really hurt me or I\u2019d lose the baby. 'Then Ian\u2019s released me and pushed me to the floor. He\u2019s gone to kick me. 'At first I think he was going to kick me hard but he held back and it wasn\u2019t a very hard kick in my back. 'Then he\u2019s picked up his bag and ran out of the gate.' Lowe was later arrested and charged with assault and was ordered not to contact Leanne under his bail conditions. But the court heard that, only an hour later, Miss McNuff rang police again to claim that Lowe had called her. The next day, February 20, Miss McNuff went in secret to an abortion clinic for a consultation. She terminated the unborn baby on March 1. Lowe found out about the abortion on March 10 - the day before the killing - when he hacked into Leanne\u2019s Facebook account, the court heard. He wrote on his page: 'She tries to ruin my career, not only are you a benefit thief you are an oxygen thief as well'. A day later, he wrote: 'Just to let everyone know Leanne had aborted the baby. 'She did not tell me or even given me a say in the matter'. The court heard that Lowe then hacked Miss McNuff's Facebook account, falsely claiming she had slept with members of her own family. That evening, Lowe went for a drink with his father and a family friend who said he 'looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders'. He is alleged to have killed Miss McNuff hours later. Lowe denies murder. The trial continues. Tributes: A policeman guards flowers left outside Miss McNuff's home following her death in March .

        "article": "The Bad Santa\u2019s Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill. By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards. Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them. Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and\u00a0Lukas Podolski looks dejected after a week of disappointment in Europe . Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers. Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack. Let us consider them in turn: . SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust. Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already. Manuel Pellegrini has won just one of his last five games as Manchester City have started to stumble . Seydou Doumbia (centre) did the damage with CSKA Moscow's goals in their 2-1 win over Manchester City . How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process. Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail. City captain Vincent Kompany looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by CSKA Moscow . City\u2019s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match. Feliz Navidad, Manuel. MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle. The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs. It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht... But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates . That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger\u2019s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match. As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well. Arsenal pair Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead . The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer? Joyeux Noel, Arsene. MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid\u2019s fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat. If Liverpool lose this one \u2013 and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders \u2013 the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid . If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself. Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth. As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: \u2018I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.\u2019 In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal . Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool\u2019s European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu. Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: \u2018What is the point of making qualification for next season\u2019s Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?\u2019 Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning . That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to \u2013 er - Basle. Merry Christmas, Brendan. Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea\u2019s Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league . However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter. This Champions League week \u2013 and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with Maribor . The best league in the world? Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea.",

        "article": "Zanzibar, Tanzania (CNN) -- A Catholic priest was attacked with acid on the east African island of Zanzibar in the third such unprovoked assault in two months, and remained hospitalized Saturday, the cleric told CNN. The Rev. Joseph Anselmo Mwagambwa said he was attacked Friday afternoon while coming out of an internet cafe in Mlandenge, a community in the city of Zanzibar. He was being treated in a hospital in the Tanzanian mainland city of Dar es Salaam. Police are still investigating, and no arrests have been made. Last month, two British women, both 18, were walking unaccompanied on a street when acid was thrown on their faces, chests and hands by two men on a motorcycle in Zanzibar, officials said. Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup were attacked in Stone Town, the island's historic center, and had been working as volunteer teachers on the island, according to the firm i-to-i Travel. Stone Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site popular with tourists. The attack against the two women came as Islamist extremism is rising in the area. The government said it would consider regulating the purchase of acid and other related products, and warned that such attacks could seriously damage the island's tourism industry. In another incident in July, a businessman of Arab origin who had built a mall close to the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam was also injured in an acid attack, Tanzanian media reported. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania. According to the CIA World Factbook, the population of Zanzibar is 99% Muslim, while the residents of mainland Tanzania are split roughly evenly among Christian, Muslim and indigenous beliefs.

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:47 AM on 27th August 2011 . Tragedy: Little Kiran Mir was left with terrible brain damage after choking on the ball . A girl of seven choked to death on a bouncy ball after it hit a wall and flew into her mouth, an inquest heard. Kiran Mir had been playing with the ball at home when it became lodged in her throat. Her mother, Shakeela, was in the room at the time of what was described by the coroner as a \u2018one in a million\u2019 chance accident. Her parents desperately tried to dislodge the toy, but the child\u2019s heart stopped and she died in hospital two days later. Her father, Shahid, 45, said: \u2018Kiran was such a happy, generous little girl. She had been to the shops with her mum and spent her pocket money on two 20p bouncy balls \u2013 one for her, and one for her sister. \u2018Suddenly, [my wife] noticed Kiran was unable to breathe. She tried to reach the ball in her mouth, and started slapping on her back. But the ball wouldn\u2019t budge.\u2019 Mr Kir, a community project manager in Birmingham who had been at work nearby at the time, arrived just before paramedics. He said: \u2018I tried holding her upside down, putting my hands under her ribs and pulling upwards. She was just floppy.\u2019 Kiran, one of four children, died on March 1 after suffering a heart attack and severe brain damage. Mr Mir said: \u2018It has devastated our family. Her siblings miss her every day.\u2019 Birmingham coroner Adrian Cotter recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: \u2018This was an unhappy chance in a million. \u2018It is quite clear she was being well supervised at the time. It happened in a moment.\u2019 He added: . 'Anyone who has children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces knows that . something like this can happen. 'I . cannot believe there is not a single parent who has not had to fish . something out of a child's mouth. It was a completely freak accident.' Speaking at the family's home in Saltley, Birmingham, Mr Mir said his daughter's death had 'killed all my happiness'. He said he, his wife aged 34, and their son Faris, aged ten, and daughters Danya, nine, and Laiba, three, had all been left devastated by the death. Mr Mir, aged 45, who works as a manager at voluntary organisation East Birmingham Community Forum, said he was at work when the tragedy happened. In a statement read out to the inquest, Mrs Bibi said the day before she had bought two small rubber balls for Kiran and one for her other children, paying 20p each for them. She said the following day she had collected her children from school, taken them back home and was changing their clothes. Mrs Bibi said: 'She was bouncing the ball between her hand and the floor. I suddenly heard Kiran cough and immediately looked towards her.' She said her daughter continued to cough and that she suspected Kiran may have swallowed the ball. She added: 'I immediately approached her and used one hand to smack her gently two or three times between her shoulder blades hoping for the ball to pop out.' Devastated: Kiran's heartbroken parents Shakeela Bibi and Shahid Mir fought to save their daughter after the ball got lodged in her throat . Freak accident: The 20p rubber ball, similar to these, bounced into the little girl's mouth . However, she said, Kiran's lips started to turn blue and she could see she was having difficulty breathing. Mrs Bibi said she took her daughter to the bathroom and that Kiran had tried to vomit. She then took her back in the living room and made further attempts to get the ball out, but realised that matters had gone beyond her control and phoned her husband. Speaking at their home, Mr Mir said he told his colleague to call for an ambulance while he rushed home. He said: 'Me and my wife carried on . trying to dislodge the ball by hitting her on the back of the throat and . also putting our arms around her chest and back and pulling upwards. 'It's killed all my happiness': Grieving Mr Mir with a picture of his little girl . 'By now the ambulance came and they took over. In the ambulance Kiran had a cardiac arrest but the paramedics managed to get her heart started again. 'When she got to Heartlands her heart had been stopped for 29 minutes and they told us she had suffered brain damage so was transferred to another hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. It's just terrible, terrible. It's killed all my happiness.' Mr Mir said his daughter was in intensive care overnight but the following day doctors said the brain damage was so severe she would never recover. He added: 'Then we had to make the difficult decision to turn off the life support machine. 'I was really reluctant to do so but they said that way she could pass away in a dignified way. 'She was always very cheerful, a really happy and loving little girl. We miss her every day - especially her sister who was also her friend and they were always playing together.' He said Kiran was also a popular motivated pupil at school and all the teachers and fellow pupils had been left devastated. Mr Mir said a memorial bench had been put in the gardens of Shaw Hill Primary School in Alum Rock, where his daughter was a pupil.",

        "article": "Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj, who plays for Alex McLeish\u2019s Belgian side Racing Genk. The Parkhead side will be looking for reinforcements in the January transfer window after a stuttering start to Ronny Deila\u2019s first season in charge. And 25-year-old Mbodj, who can play as a defender or a holding midfielder, is one of the names being targeted. Celtic are in the hunt for Senegal international Kara Mbodj, who plays for Alex McLeish\u2019s side Racing Genk . But Celtic are expected to face competition for his signature from south of the border, with Barclays Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and West Ham United also credited with an interest in the 25-year-old. Deila knows Mbodj well after he played for Norwegian side Tromso for two years, with the Celtic boss encountering him on numerous occasions when he was in charge of Stromsdgodset. Mbodj said: \u2018I can confirm that British clubs are showing interest in me. \u2018But I don\u2019t want this to distract from my focus which is to get Genk as high up the league as possible. Ronny Deila is looking for some defensive cover and Mbodj can play in both defence and holding midfield . \u2018In January we will talk to these clubs and I will make a decision on my future then.\u2019 Mbodj has helped transform McLeish\u2019s side from relegation contenders to European place hopefuls in the Belgian Pro League - and it\u2019s that form that will see Celtic look closely at the talented African. Meanwhile, midfielder Stefan Johansen has apologised to Celtic fans for the 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice and says the Scottish champions will make Ross County pay in their next league match. The 25-year-old has scored once in his 12 appearances for the Senegalese senior side . With Deila\u2019s men hosting Jim McIntyre\u2019s struggling Highlanders at Parkhead on Saturday, Norwegian international Johansen said: \u2018Good teams bounce back right away so we will just focus on training well and focus on that game - because we want to get back on the winning run. \u2018Ross County always try to defend and then counter attack, but if we do our own things well enough, then we should beat them and that\u2019s what we have to focus on. \u2018The fans were fantastic at Tannadice and it was a joy to play in front of them so I\u2019d like to say sorry we couldn\u2019t win.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose \"People Power\" movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced Saturday. \"She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy,\" said Ray Donato, the nation's consul-general in Atlanta. Aquino, the first woman to lead the Philippines, had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday (3:18 p.m. Friday ET), said Mai Mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III. Funeral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.  Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said Ray Donato, the country's consul-general in Atlanta. \"She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy, and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency,\" Donato said. Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States. She had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr., was gunned down at Manila's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile. The political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's Roman Catholic churches. Marcos had been backed by the United States, the former colonial power in the Philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. Aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help. She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States. Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the \"orderly withdrawal\" of U.S. forces.",

        "article": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Police closed streets near London's Canary Wharf financial district on Saturday after an unexploded German flying bomb from World War II was found on a construction site. WWII bombs are unearthed across Europe, often during building excavations, such as this one in France. Bomb disposal experts were called in to make the V1 missile safe after it was unearthed close to the east London complex that houses 80,000 office workers during the working week, police said. At weekends the area is busy with shoppers and visitors. Police closed several roads around the site in Millharbour, a road in the former docklands. \"Ambulance, fire and police are there and the building site has been evacuated,\" a London police spokesman said. The area was cordoned off, he said. Thousands of V1s, nicknamed \"Doodlebugs\", were fired at the capital during the war, with the docks a prime target. Hundreds of unexploded bombs from the war are buried across the country, according to government figures. They are unearthed from time to time, often during building excavations.

        "article": "By . Rebecca English . Beauty, they say, is in the eye of the beholder. But as the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s first official portrait was unveiled to the public yesterday, art critics were, unusually, largely united in their condemnation. \u2018Ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster,\u2019 was the view of the editor of the British Art Journal, Robin Simon. Scroll down for video . The Duchess attended the gallery for the unveiling of the first official portrait of her painted by Paul Emsley . Real impact: The painting is much bigger than lifesize - which one art critic called a 'jolly brave' choice . One to show the grandchildren? The pregnant Duchess looked in high spirits as she arrived at the gallery for a private viewing this morning ahead of the public unveiling . Their muse: The Duchess introduces her husband to artist Paul Emsley after viewing his portrait at the National Portrait Gallery . \u2018It\u2019s only saving grace is that it\u2019s not by Rolf Harris,\u2019 was the best that David Lee, now editor of The Jackdaw and a former editor of Art Review, could manage. Kate, on her first official outing for almost a month, was far more polite. \u2018It\u2019s just amazing. Absolutely brilliant,\u2019 she told the artist, Paul Emsley, when she met him at the National Portrait Gallery, where the picture will hang. Her husband, Prince William, nodded sagely. \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s absolutely beautiful,\u2019 he concurred. From others, however, the biggest criticism seemed to be the generally ageing nature of the portrait, which took three and a half months to produce. Most seemed to think it makes the duchess, who turned 31 this week, look at least 15 years older. Portrait of the artist: Emsley working on the painting at his studio in Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, using a photo taken when the Duchess visited him there in May . What he saw: The artist said he wanted to emphasise Kate's 'sparkling green eyes' Then there are the shadows and creases . which give her a rather baggy-eyed look, not to mention the squareness . of her jaw and the rather coppery tint to her famously tumbling brunette . locks. One onlooker at the gallery yesterday . couldn\u2019t get over what they described as her \u2018grey, smoker\u2019s skin\u2019, . while another commented that her mouth appears to be set in a grimace . rather than the promised enigmatic smile. The glittering sapphire and diamond earrings Kate wears in her portrait were once owned by Princess Diana, who received them as a wedding present from Prince Charles. William\u2019s mother was given the earrings by Charles because they bore a startling resemblance to her engagement ring \u2013 which is now also worn by the daughter-in-law she never got to meet. Diana famously wore the jewels on the cover of Vogue in July 1994, as well as on numerous other public occasions. After her death it is understood they were returned to Charles who gave them to his \u2018darling daughter-in-law\u2019 when she married William in 2011. Kate first wore them in public on her royal tour to Canada, after having them slightly remodelled. While the director of the National . Portrait Gallery, Sandy Nairne, declared himself delighted by such a . \u2018captivating image\u2019, most members of the public who trooped into Room 37 . after the unveiling took one look at the portrait before turning . excitedly to the half-naked video of sleeping footballer David Beckham . made by Sam Taylor-Wood, which was playing nearby. To be fair, royal portraiture has . always been a subjective issue. Rolf Harris, who was asked to paint the . Queen in 2005, admitted that in the early stages he made the monarch . look like a \u2018pork butcher from Norwich\u2019. Mr Emsley, who has garnered plaudits . for his wildlife paintings, has always divided critics with his . realistic, almost \u2018photographic\u2019 style of painting. Renowned critic Brian Sewell has . described it as \u2018sickening\u2019, but the artist has won several prestigious . awards including the 1997 BP Portrait Award. The National Portrait Gallery, of which . Kate is patron, drew up a shortlist of four painters but the duchess, . who graduated from St Andrews with a 2:1 in history of art and . previously studied at the British Institute in Florence, plumped for Mr . Emsley. She posed for the artist before she . became pregnant, having one sitting at his studio in Bradford-on-Avon, . Wiltshire, followed by another at Kensington Palace in London, in May . and June last year. He also worked from a series of photos he took of the duchess. The finished picture shows her in a . Windsor blue pussy-bow blouse imagined by the artist because she wore . different outfits for each of her sittings. Yesterday Kate, wearing a burgundy . dress from High Street store Whistles and displaying no sign of her . 12-week baby bump, brought along her parents, sister and brother for the . great unveiling. They spent around ten minutes looking . at the picture before attending a private breakfast reception, after . which the media were allowed in. Asked what the duchess thought of his . work, Mr Emsley said yesterday: \u2018I think, from what I can see this . morning, she\u2019s delighted with it. I\u2019m very happy about that.\u2019 He said Kate had personally chosen the . photo she wanted him to work from because of the way her hair fell, the . light on her face and her expression generally. But he admitted he had changed the . colour of the duchess\u2019s eyes slightly on finished oil to match \u2018the . background and the colour of her blouse\u2019. He added: \u2018What she wanted was that the portrait should convey her natural self as opposed to her official self. \u2018The fact she is a beautiful woman is, . for an artist, difficult. When you have lines and\u00a0 wrinkles it is much . easier as an artist to capture them as a\u00a0 person. Obviously she has none . of that. \u2018But I tried to do that with her smile and hope I have succeeded.\u2019 The portrait, which is likely to have . cost upwards of \u00a320,000, has been donated to the gallery by art . philanthropist Sir Hugh Legatt. The Duchess appeared to be showing the first signs of a baby bump as she was photographed outside the gallery . Kate arrives at the gallery with Prince William. The baby is likely to be moving about but its movements will be too small for Kate to feel them just yet . Did he get it right? The artist, who has previously painted Nelson Mandela, was keen to capture Kate's \u2018charm, serenity and intelligence\u2019 as well as her \u2018sparkling green eyes . Art enthusiast: The young royals chose Emsley from a shortlist drawn up by the NPG . Warm: An animated Kate told Emsley the portrait was 'amazing... absolutely brilliant' Scrawl: Louise Mensch retweeted an 'official portrait' posted online by writer Jenny Colgan . Support: Kate's father Michael, left, and brother James Middleton also attended the viewing this morning .

        "article": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Students at a university in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou were given a scare last week, after dozens of snakes invaded the campus. The Guangzhou Daily reported Monday that animal control experts had caught around 40 live snakes on Saturday after a number of the reptiles were spotted writhing along a road in Guangzhou University City. Around 60 snakes were also found dead, most squashed by traffic. \"On the way to the library I saw a green snake lying on the road in the sun, about 50 cm long,\" the newspaper quoted one student as writing on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. A student from South China Normal University, one of a number of institutions with colleges on the island campus, told her friends to be careful after finding about 60 snakes -- some run over by cars and other lurking in the grass. An official at Sun Yat-Sen University contacted by CNN confirmed that snakes had been found but said they did not know any details. Zhang Liang, from the South China Institute of Endangered Animals, identified the snakes as chequered keelbacks, a common species in the region, and said they were not poisonous. \"This kind of snake likes the sun. It's timid and will not hurt people,\" he said. If they came across a snake, he said that students should call the city's wild animal protection bureau and not poke or try to catch it. Zhang said he suspected that the snakes had been released deliberately. Most of the captured snakes had bite marks on their bodies, suggesting they had been kept in a confined space. The snake invasion was not a signifier of an earthquake or other natural disaster, he cautioned, after students described the incident as an apocalyptic sign. CNN's Zhang Dayu and Stephanie Ma in Beijing contributed to this report .",

Dr David Kelly, who was found dead a decade ago today after leaking that the Blair government had 'sexed up' the Iraq dossier . Doctors campaigning for an investigation into the death of Iraq weapons expert Dr David Kelly believe he was the victim of a Hillsborough-style cover-up. The group says it would be \u2018shameful\u2019 if the truth about the death was suppressed in a similar way to that of the 1989 football stadium tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died. The doctors claim to have \u2018multiple serious concerns\u2019 over evidence used in the case and fear there were \u2018serious deficiencies\u2019 in the investigation by police. The group is calling for a full inquest into Dr Kelly\u2019s death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police. The chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead a decade ago today, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair\u2019s Government had \u2018sexed up\u2019 the case for war in Iraq. The Hutton Report later found that Dr Kelly, a member of a UN inspection team sent to Iraq to unearth weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. However, many still believe the 59-year-old scientist may have been murdered by the security services. The group of doctors, which is led by the radiologist Stephen Frost and includes Andrew Watt, David Halpin and Christopher Burns-Cox, says Dr Kelly\u2019s death is \u2018a matter of continuing public and professional concern\u2019. Their statement said: \u2018In the interests of justice, both an inquest into Dr Kelly\u2019s death and an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into what we consider to be a deficient and dishonest investigation by Thames Valley Police are required. \u2018The British public had to wait 23 years for the truth about the Hillsborough disaster to emerge. \u2018It would be shameful if the truth about the suspicious death of Dr David Kelly were concealed for a similar length of time.\u2019 Dr David Halpin, a member of the group of doctors that is group is calling for a full inquest into Dr Kelly\u00bfs death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police .

UEFA had insisted they would field a challenger even if Michel Platini decided, as he did in Monaco last week, to continue for another term as European football\u2019s kingpin. But that ambition was defeated during a meeting of the 54 European countries in Monte Carlo when a number of delegates - notably from Finland and Iceland - made it clear they were happy with the way Blatter and FIFA were running the world game.

Happy where he is: Michel Platini has confirmed he wants to stay head of UEFA and not challenge Blatter .

Then, the UEFA countries agreed to vote for age and term restrictions for the FIFA presidency but when the FIFA vote took place, only 33 of the 54 nations actually backed the limits. As a result, none of Europe\u2019s big hitters would want to oppose Blatter when not even assured of full support within UEFA. Meanwhile, the sight of Platini chilling out at the beach bar at the Meridien Plaza in Monaco after completing his Champions League draw duties helped explain why he is content to run European football for another four years rather than dip his toe in the murkier Zurich waters. Trigger-happy Leeds owner Massimo Cellino is understood to have contacted Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid to ask about his assistant Paul Clement as a possible manager at Elland Road. However, the conversation didn\u2019t last long after Cellino was told that Clement, who turned down West Bromwich, is earning nearly \u00a32million a year in Spain.

Instead of staying there before every game, which had been the plan, the senior team will now only be based at SGP when it suits, with the players not relishing the 130-mile journey from Burton to Wembley.

        "article": "As he walked through the tunnel en route to the first tee Justin Rose gave a fist bump to the mural that showed Seve Ballesteros striking a similar pose. After hitting a miraculous shot out of the bushes on the 13th to within two feet of the flag the 34-year-old Englishman turned to the accompanying camera and remarked \u2018A bit of Seve for ya!\u2019 These evocations of the great Spaniard might have been out of character for a normally undemonstrative man but Rose\u2019s performances over the past three days seemed to be infused by the spirit of Ballesteros, a man so famously enthused by the Ryder Cup. Justin Rose was Europe's MVP over the weekend, picking up four points from five matches . VIDEO Ryder Cup highlights . By the end of it all last year\u2019s US Open champion had contributed almost 25 per cent of Europe\u2019s points to become, in the phraseology of their opponents, the MVP: most valuable player of the event. On the final day others made more eyecatching contributions than the hard-earned half he managed against Hunter Mahan, who he finally clawed back having gone four down after the sixth. That he outmatched the American\u2019s seven birdies with eight of his own told of the quality of the match. Later he acknowledged the debt owed to Ballesteros but also cited as an inspiration the more unlikely figure of Sweden\u2019s Peter Hanson, who played on the team in Medinah. Rose kisses the trophy he worked so hard to help win, with European captain Paul McGinley watching on . Rose said he was inspired by Peter Hanson who fought hard on the final day of the singles in 2012 . \u2018On the front nine I was basically trying to be Peter Hanson,\u2019 said Rose. \u2018He was six down to Jason Dufner on the Sunday two years ago but ended up taking him all the way up the 18th. \u2018That sent an important message to the rest of the team that day, that we were still in there fighting, and I wanted to send the same message.\u2019 The mild-mannered Rose does not have the flamboyance of Ballesteros or the in-your-face quality of Ian Poulter but this team format sees him transformed into fist-pumper in chief, and he is quietly assembling a Ryder Cup record to stand with any of them. Today it reads nine wins, two halves and three losses after his four points that will go down as one of the finest European performances in the competition over the past 30 years. Hanson (right) and Rose (second right) celebrate in Medinah after the remarkable comeback win . The Englishman produced one of the finest displays by a European, complete with uncharacteristic emotions . Had he not been paired with Martin Kaymer on Saturday afternoon, or Mahan not been so impressive yesterday, then his tally might have been of more historic proportions. His high-water mark came on Saturday morning when, in completing three wins out of three with Henrik Stenson, he was sinking putts with the ease of a man placing litter in the bin. He could have been excused feeling weary yesterday, especially going so far behind, but instead responded with a run of five straight birdies. And then there was the amazing save at the 13th, which was where Ballesteros especially came in. \u2018When I walked up to my ball it was in the gorse bush and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m dead here\u201d, and all I could do was try to punch out an eight-iron. 'Seve was at his best when he was trying to make something out nothing, I\u2019ve been watching footage of him doing that my whole life so that\u2019s why I thought of him. Rose channeled the spirit of Seve when playing from difficult positions as he led Europe to glory . \u2018It just felt so Ryder Cup, and how he used to battle away and never give up. He is still fresh in our memory and has a big impact on us. Here his was the last image you would see before walking onto the first tee, and we had a big picture of him in our team room as well.\u2019 What eternally fascinates about a competition that wraps up an essentially individual pursuit into a team format is that it can make some grow beyond their stature and diminish others. While Rose\u2019s collegiate temperament makes him a natural fit, there were fears beforehand that the more introverted Victor Dubuisson might struggle with all that it entails. Yet Dubuisson emerged with two-and-a-half points from three, and looked like he and Graeme McDowell had been playing together since childhood. Others, such as Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson, showed that veering from their norm of merely looking after their own games is not conducive to producing their best. Stephen Gallacher found the experience overwhelming on the front nine of his first outing, although he fared better yesterday and was unlucky to be drawn against a determined Phil Mickelson. Bubba Watson looks glum after the world No 2 lost all three of his matches at Gleneagles . Rickie Fowler has still never won a match at the Ryder Cup after losing heavily to Rory McIlroy . Fowler has now played for eight points in the Ryder Cup and failed to win any of them, becoming only the fifth man in the last 10 editions not to register a full point from five matches, although he did manage three halves. Watson is a more striking example, and in going 0-3 at Gleneagles has now lost eight of his 11 matches, despite having won two of the last three Masters. \u2018I guess I\u2019m too nice,\u2019 he said. That was once the label attached to the charming Rose, although it is now well and truly defunct.",

But these kitties are surely risking one of their nine lives in a hilarious skydving stunt to promote an insurance firm. While it may look like these fearless furry felines are freefalling thousands of feet, animal lovers can rest assured that no animals were harmed in the making of the advert. Despite its convincing appearance, it has emerged that the commercial was produced using green screen technology. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flying cats: The video opens with the furry animals freefalling through the sky over what is presumably Sweden . Unflustered: The cats look relatively unscathed as they fall with squinted eyes and the wind blowing through their fur . Convincing: Although green screen technology was used to create the hilarious footage, many viewers were fooled into thinking that the cats actually took part in a real skydive . Don't look down: An aerial shot shows just how high up the cats appear to be . The advert is for customer owned Swedish insurance company Folksam in honour of one of its customers, Eva Leijonmark, who has her beloved cat covered by the firm. The company had asked its customers for advertising ideas, but probably didn't bargain on Eva's wacky concept. The video shows the cats appearing to freefall with squinted eyes and the wind rushing through their fur. The group then join up in formation linking paws in an adorable attempt to spell out the word Eva across the sky. Set to R Kelly's 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly, the ad then shows the moggies parachutes opening as they begin the slow descent back down to earth. Produced by advertising agency Akestam.holst, the 40 second video has gone viral with almost 500,000 hits on YouTube.

Cute: The moggies hold paws as they move into formation . While most viewers appear to see the funny side of the clip, some seem to be fooled into thinking that the cats involved were actually thrown from a plane. The company has said that it followed animal welfare laws to ensure that the animals were unhurt in during the filming. It is one of Sweden's oldest insurance firms and the advert is, of course, designed to promote its pet insurance policies. Impressive: The cats spell out the word Eva in honour of the customer who came up with the idea for the advert . Fearless: The cats break formation and begin to freefall to earth again against a back drop of a bright sun .

        "article": "(CNN) -- The Pennsylvania attorney general may be taking a second look at the actions of a rural high school where Jerry Sandusky was a volunteer coach in 2008 and where administrators have been publicly criticized for discouraging a student from making allegations of sexual abuse against the then-famous coach. That student, Aaron Fisher, later became known as the first of 10 victims in a scathing indictment of serial and predatory child sex abuse by Sandusky, who is now serving 30 years in prison for his crimes. The co-author of Fisher's book, Mike Gillum, told CNN that he and Fisher's mother have been approached by investigators with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office about the actions of administrators at Central Mountain High School in 2008. Matt Sandusky files motion to have name changed . Sandusky was a volunteer football coach and would often take Fisher from class without his mother's permission. Fisher, who was abused for four years, launched the investigation into Sandusky when he came forward to police in 2009. Fisher's mother has repeatedly said that the high school principal told her to wait and think about the implications of accusing Sandusky before calling authorities. Although there's been talk about an investigation by the state department of Education or by federal authorities, Gillum said this inquiry by the attorney general is the first time Fisher, his mom or Gillum have been contacted by investigators about the actions of school administrators. Sandusky's son, six others reach settlement with Penn State . In the past year, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane has launched a case-wide review of the Sandusky investigation because of numerous criticisms about the two-year gap between Fisher's report and Sandusky's arrest, plus allegations that charges weren't filed against others who might have known about Sandusky's abuse for months. Two former administrators and the former president of Penn State are facing trial on charges related to an alleged cover-up at the university.

        "article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage has pretty much got this acting thing down. After all, he started acting at the age of 15 and, well, he's got that Oscar. Nicolas Cage says that Academy Awards are \"not as important as children and making them happy.\" So he doesn't really need to deliver another gut-wrenching performance to demonstrate his chops. In fact, he can deviate from a traditional film and venture into animated territory. He's voiced animated characters in the past, but in Disney's new 3-D tale \"G-Force,\" Cage lends his voice to a mole. Speckles the star-nosed mole comes to life thanks to the film's impressive digital animation and Cage's voice. At first it's unclear that Cage is the voice behind Speckles, because he changes his sound for the critter, er, character. CNN talked to Cage about playing a mole, animated films and his taking walks in the forest. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What do you play in this film? Nicolas Cage: I'm playing Speckles, the mole, and he's an outsider. He's an iconoclast -- he doesn't fit in. He doesn't get into the fray with the \"G-Force,\" the other guinea pigs. But his IQ is off the charts, and he's a technological wizard. CNN: So, you're an Academy Award-winning actor, and you decided to play (this role). How did this come about? Cage: To me, nothing's more sacred than the magical world of children, and with everything that's going on in the world, it gets increasingly more challenging to keep our kids smiling -- people are losing their jobs, families are tense. So anything I can do to give families something to look forward to and to put a smile back on children's faces -- I'm gonna do. Disney has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold. I mean, you mention Academy Awards -- I mean, that's not as important as children and making them happy. CNN: Tell me about your voice: Why did you decide to really change it when you read the script? Cage: Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig. To me, he's a great actor. I mean, one of the great character actors, and I knew that if I was gonna be in this movie, I'd want to do something like that and transform my voice. CNN: So you're clearly comfortable playing a mole? Cage: I'm comfortable with the mole, yeah. I mean, yeah, he's different, he's got issues, you know? I don't want a perfect character, I want a character who has, as strange as it sounds, some humanity, some flaws, some needs. But to be fair, I'm not in a lot of this movie. This is Darwin's movie, um Sam Rockwell and Penelope Cruz's movie -- they're the stars. I'm only in it at the beginning and the end. CNN : You seem to be a big fan of animated films. Cage: I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like \"Spirited Away\" and \"Howl's Moving Castle.\" I like movies where you feel like you're going into another world, and no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna see something new in that world. That level of detail really inspires me. CNN: Is there less pressure doing an animated film and lending your voice to a character as opposed to a traditional film? Cage: Well, you don't have the pressure of the camera. And that's -- that's very liberating. And you don't have the pressure of other actors trying to remember their dialogue or not being in rhythm with you. The challenge though is, these movies take years to make, and I may not be in the same state of mind I was in a year ago or two years ago, and then they tend to pull you out of wherever you are and put you back in a box, and then try to get the voice out of you again, so that's the rub. CNN: Have you gotten pretty good at honing your skills when it comes to choosing roles, or is it always a risk? Cage: I mean it is always a gamble. You never know what's gonna happen with a movie. But I think it's more of a matter of, am I doing something that I believe in on any level? Like, am I going to entertain children, or am I going to make a movie that I can stand by because it means well on some level? That's becoming more and more a part of the criteria. CNN: How do you think you've changed as an actor throughout your career? Cage: I think I've become more relaxed. I don't feel the need to jump up and down and make a big noise to get people to pay attention to me. I don't need to um, you know, do punk rock gestures or eat a cockroach or do something weird to say I exist. I feel like I'm hearing a different kind of sound now. It's a much more subtle sound, but it's still a truthful sound, that I can express myself in, in roles that are much more relaxed and seasoned as opposed to boisterous and rock and roll. CNN: What's inspiring to you, in every day. Cage: Well, I find children inspiring. The way they look at the world. The magical world they live in, to me, is inspiring. I like -- I mean, I'm afraid I'm gonna answer your questions and sound like a complete nature addict here, but uh, I like nature, I enjoy going for walks, I like the ocean, I like the forest. CNN: Is that what you do when you're not working, that's important to you in your life? Cage: Yes. Yes, I like to go for walks in the forest.",

        "summary": "A military hearing is underway at Fort Hood for the suspect in last year's shootings on the base .\nA prosecution parade of witnesses began last week .\nMost of the shooting victims were preparing for Iraq or Afghanistan when they were hit .",
        "article": "Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The distant rumble of big guns on Fort Hood's artillery range rattles the ceiling tiles in the small military courtroom. But the sounds of war training don't interrupt the intensity inside the military hearing as dozens of witnesses here recal that day last November when 13 people were shot to death and 32 wounded on the base in central Texas. Training with Paladin howitzers is part of everyday life at Fort Hood, the country's largest Army base. Most of the shooting victims were preparing to ship out to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. But nothing prepared them for what happened to them at home -- dodging bullets as a gunman cut down their buddies. The prosecution put up more than two dozen witnesses in the first three full days of the Article 32 hearing. Prosecutors have set aside two more weeks, and scores more witnesses are expected. The Article 32 hearing will reconvene in November for defense attorneys to make their case. Then an Army colonel, -- the Investigating officer presiding over this hearing -- will decide if there is enough evidence to push the case along toward a court martial with a possible penalty of death upon conviction. During live video testimony from Afghanistan, fighter jets roared overhead as soldiers described how their safe and secure base suddenly became a bloody battleground. Capt. Melissa Kale was speaking from Kandahar, Afghanistan, on Friday. But her thoughts were back at Fort Hood trying to get a wounded buddy out of the line of fire. \"I was unable to pull her. She didn't move. I had to leave her there,\" Kale said, crying. Many of the victims are haunted by their memories, with multiple accounts of hearing a scream of \"Allahu Akbar\" -- Arabic for \"God is great\" -- before the fast firing of a handgun, a laser-sight flickering across faces, signaling who might be next to fall. \"It was a nightmare that reoccurs every day,\" said Spc. Megan Martin, who also spoke via video-link from Afghanistan. She rejected any thought of trying to postpone her deployment just a few weeks after the shooting. \"I wanted to carry out the mission as my fellow soldiers would have wanted me to.\" Martin said. During the shooting, some tried to fight back, others pretended to be dead or tried to hide. There were multiple accounts of one man trying to rush the gunman, holding a chair above his head, only to be cut down at close range. \"You can't stay here and die,\" Spc. Logan Burnett said he told people trying to hide from the bullets. He told how he tried to knock down the gunman with a folding table. \"I turned to throw it at the shooter. At that point I was hit in the hip,\" Burnett said Friday. He was shot two more times. The man accused of the attacks, Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan, is wheeled into the courtroom each morning by Army police wearing blue uniforms, their holsters empty. Hasan is in a wheelchair, partially paralyzed from being shot four times by police who rushed to the shooting scene. Hasan sits impassively, wearing the same Army fatigues and high-lace-up combat boots as the judge and most of the lawyers. But Hasan is easy to spot on the far left of the defense table, wearing a fleece watch-cap pulled low in the back, over his ears, and almost down to his thick eyebrows in front. Some days he complains of the cold and the guards carry an Army blanket to drape over his shoulders. At the start of proceedings Friday he gave a quick grin to one of his defense lawyers but then sat expressionless. He writes on a legal pad, and occasionally braces his arms on the arms of the wheelchair and pushes his body up to readjust his position. The courtroom is paneled with dark wood. There are only 45 spectator seats and many were empty on Friday. There is tight security with journalists selected by lottery to be able to attend in person. Other journalists can see the proceedings in a viewing room with a problem-plagued video feed provided by the Army in in a temporary press center set up 200 yards away. The defense tried unsuccessfully to have the hearing closed to the public or postponed. Still untouched is any discussion of motive. Hasan's lawyers have been asking many of the witnesses whether they thought the firing was random or targeted. The presiding officer, Col. James Pohl, said even he found that confusing. \"I just don't know what you mean by 'random,'\" Pohl said. One Friday witness, because of his injuries, was unable to raise his right arm when he took the oath. He said the shot felt like he'd been hit by a baseball bat in the neck. Witness after witness told how they still carry bullets in their bodies, how they must face additional operations or how their physical therapy continues, how they may go to psychological counseling. The prosecution has two more weeks to present evidence. Then the court will recess as Fort Hood marks one year since the shootings. The base is planning a variety of activities that week, including a private event for families of the victims, and an awards ceremony to honor members of the military and civilians who performed with exceptional courage that day. The following week, if more testimony is waiting, the hearing will resume.",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:56 EST, 8 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 8 August 2012 . Facebook has been dealt yet another blow as three of its top executives have announced they are quitting the social networking company. Director of platform partnerships, Ethan Beard, director of platform marketing, Katie Mitic, and mobile platform marketing manager, Jonathan Matus, have handed in their resignations. They are just the latest top-ranking employees to quit the San Francisco-based company, which has lost a handful of execs following its poorly received IPO in May and tumbling share prices. Resignations: Three more Facebook execs have quit, including director of platform partnerships Ethan Beard (left), and Katie Mitic (right), director of platform marketing. Both are starting new ventures . Their announcements - shared on their Facebook pages - come after the high-profile exits of chief technology officer Bret Taylor in June, and Open Graph product manager Carl Sjogreen last month. 'It is with mixed emotions that I'm . letting you all know that I've decided to leave Facebook to seek my next . adventure,' Beard wrote on his Facebook page. 'I'm exceptionally proud of the team . we've built and the work we've done and I'm incredibly enthusiastic . about the future of Facebook... and know that I'm leaving it in the good . hands.' Mitic, who will be working at a mobile . startup, wrote: 'After an amazing two years at Facebook, it's time to . start my next entrepreneurial adventure. I'm so grateful to have met, . learned from and worked with the incredible people here.' Out the door: Jonathan Matus (left), Facebook's mobile platform marketing manager, has also handed in his resignation. It comes two months after Bret Taylor (right), chief technology officer quit . Farewell: Facebook's director of platform products Carl Sjogreen, pictured unveiling the social networking site's Timeline Apps in January this year, left the company in June . The resignations, which come as Facebook struggles with plummeting share prices, will only serve to rattle the company further. It lost a staggering $157 . million in the second quarter of this year and saw shares, which were . released in a highly-anticipated IPO in May, fall to $20.72 from their . $38 starting price. Last week, shares hit an all-time low of $19.82 after the company posted its disappointing earnings. Facebook's initial valuation has plummeted from $100 billion to $43.5 billion, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal fortune collapse from $13.7 billion to $10 billion over the last fortnight. But the company has defended the drain of talent, pointing out that new employees are joining the company on a weekly basis, which constantly helps the development of ideas. 'We're fortunate to have many, many . talented people join the company each week, and we believe this will . serve us well over the long run,' Facebook spokesman Larry Yu said in a . statement. Crash: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the IPO launch in May - but shares have almost halved since . Plummeting: Last week, Facebook share prices hit an all time low of $19.82 - down from its original $38 . Social-media analyst Greg Sterling warned that Silicon Valley is rife with start ups, and many Facebook employees are going on to begin their own companies. 'Start-up junkies get restless after a . few years,' Sterling told USA Today. 'This is not a . time to lose top talent. That is Facebook's challenge.' These fledgling departures are definitely true of Facebook; Beard worked at the company for four years, yet Mitic was there for two years and Matus only lasted one. Mitic and Matus likely received stock before the IPO and will keep it despite their departures; they could be betting the stock will not gain so much value over the next couple of years that they will miss out on a large payout, USA Today reported. Concerns: These latest resignations of top-ranking employees will only serve to shake Facebook further . While Facebook has suffered devastating losses, the day most investors are bracing for is November 14, when more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for trading. The imminent lock-up expiration also means that Wall Street analysts who participated in the Facebook IPO will once again go quiet, for a 30-day period, potentially creating more uncertainty. 'The sentiment on this thing is so negative,' said Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony. 'I think this thing may continue to tick down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately may not show until third-quarter earnings.'",

        "article": "It may be meant as friendly advice, but telling someone they are piling on the pounds just makes them delve further into the biscuit tin. Those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are six times as likely to become obese, a study has found. Experts say that being criticised for their weight drives those who are already sensitive about it to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise. Scroll down for video . Those who are made to feel ashamed about their size are 'six times as likely to become obese' (file picture) Researchers from University College London said that the obesity crisis could be eased by teaching people \u2013 including doctors \u2013 that it is counterproductive to discriminate against others because they are overweight. They said that public health campaigns should also avoid making people feel bad about their weight. Lead author Sarah Jackson advises medics to avoid using the word \u2018fat\u2019 where possible and replace it with the terms overweight or obese. The study involved almost 3,000 English men and women aged 50-plus who were weighed twice, four years apart. They were also asked if they had been discriminated against because of their weight. Examples of this included being treated with disrespect \u2013 including being the butt of jokes \u2013 receiving poorer service in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors\u2019 surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid. Researchers from University College London said that the obesity crisis could be eased by teaching people that it is counterproductive to discriminate against others because they are overweight (file picture) Some 5 per cent said they had been treated differently because of their weight \u2013 with the figure rising to 36 per cent among those who were the most overweight. The study, published in the journal Obesity, found that those who were victims of \u2018fat shaming\u2019 put on just over 2lb on average over the course of the study. They were also six times as likely to become obese. In contrast, those who were not criticised for their weight actually became slimmer, albeit by a small amount. Dr Jackson said: \u2018Our results show that weight discrimination does not encourage weight loss and suggest that it may even exacerbate weight gain. \u2018Previous studies have shown that people who experience discrimination report comfort eating. The study found that those who were victims of \u2018fat shaming\u2019 - such as in shops, restaurants (file picture) and hospitals - put on just over 2lb on average over the course of the study . Stress responses to discrimination can increase appetite, particularly for unhealthy, energy-dense food. Weight discrimination has also been shown to make people feel less confident about taking part in physical activity, so they tend to avoid it. People may not feel comfortable going to the gym if they think they are being judged because of their weight.\u2019 Previous research has shown that it is not just the general public who are guilty of making the overweight feel ashamed of their size. Dr Jackson said: \u2018Studies have shown that quite a wide range of health professionals hold negative attitudes about obese people and patients pick up on that bias. \u2018Doctors tend to spend less time with obese patients. They feel that treating obesity is a futile task and many avoid doing it. \u2018We need to find a way of addressing this during training, highlighting that blaming and shaming isn\u2019t going to help resolve the problem.\u2019 University College London Professor Jane Wardle said: \u2018Our study clearly shows that weight discrimination is part of the obesity problem and not the solution.\u2019 Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: \u2018If you are aggressive with the way you put the message across and denigrate and tease, you are not going to get anywhere at all. What you need is tough love.\u2019 He suggested that instead of talking about fat, medics should warn about the consequences of obesity, such as risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes \u2013 blindness, amputation and early death. In 2008, the word \u2018obese\u2019 was banned on official letters to parents of overweight children. \u2018It was replaced by the term \u2018very overweight\u2019 on warning letters sent out as part of a national child measurement programme.",

This is the huge steel arch that will entomb Chernobyl's reactor four, and slash the risk of another radioactive disaster. The construction, which is one of the biggest engineering projects in history, is being built to seal off nuclear fuel buried inside reactor four which blew up in 1986. Standing 360 feet tall, and 843 feet wide, the arch will be held together by 680,000 bolts. The Chernobyl arch is one of the biggest engineering projects in history .

Costing \u00a31.5billion to build the feat of engineering is a small price to pay to prevent another disaster like the one which blighted generations in the Ukrainian region. Radiation from the blast also spread across the former USSR and Europe prompting fears at the the time about the safety of nuclear power stations.

        "summary": "Bob Besal crashed plane into water nearly 38 years ago .\nHe recently learned wreckage from the plane had been found .\nBesal joined divers on a journey to see the remains .\nRuins are now part of an active reef .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- Bob Besal went on a fishing trip this month off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida. The 62-year-old retired rear admiral, who earned two Distinguished Flying Cross awards and spent a lifetime on the water and above it, didn't catch any fish, but he did return with some memorable souvenirs. Twenty miles from shore and 80 feet under the Atlantic, parts of Besal's past were brought to the surface. Nearly 38 years ago, the naval aviator made a critical decision that almost cost him his life and ultimately defined it. Besal and three other pilots were simulating bombing runs on a training mission when his Vought A-7 Corsair clipped the plane next to him. Besal ejected at a speed close to 350 mph. \"It's not one of those things you brag about, honestly,\" laughed Besal. \"I didn't cover myself in glory on December 2, 1974. So it's one of those things if people asked I would tell them, but I didn't try to advertise it as such.\" Pilot who survived midair collision decades ago learns wreckage found . The wreckage of Besal's plane was found last month by a team of divers from TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a Jacksonsville-based marine conservation company that specializes, among other things, in building artificial reefs. A data plate picked up off the ocean floor was traced back to Besal, who now teaches aviation maintenance technology in Charleston, South Carolina. Joe Kistel, executive director of TISIRI, asked Besal if he would like to return to the wreckage site, an invitation Besal eagerly accepted. Just after dawn on a recent Saturday morning, Besal joined a crew for a 90-minute ride to the wreckage site. Little did he know that the decades-old ruins had become part of a productive ecosystem. \"The fact we could determine it was his aircraft and locate Bob and actually bring him out here to visit the reef his wreckage had created, it's actually a very gratifying experience for us,\" said Kistel who had previously dived several times at the site now thriving with fish. Sea bass, scorpion, trigger and octopus now call the broken metal structure home. See the underwater wreckage . Kistel has no immediate plans to retrieve the larger plane parts. Said Kistel, \"We've notified the military of where (the plane is located) ... Mother Nature is doing the rest.\" Daughter searches for missing father . The trip brings back memories for Besal, who was just 24 at the time of the accident. His misjudgment during a roll left brought his plane too close to an aircraft piloted by his squadron's commanding officer. \"It was the last thing he expected that morning, I'm sure, that I would bump into him up there.\" That plane made it safely back to base. Besal never saw his own aircraft go into the water because he was above the clouds when he ejected, and shortly afterward he was picked up by a training helicopter in the area. Besal, who went on to become commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS America, spent 30 years in the Navy. He used his flying miscalculation to develop a greater appreciation for errors made by others. He taught the next generation of cadets that mistakes are a part of life and what matters is what one does with second-chance opportunities. Floating above the wreckage, he took advantage of his. Diving conditions were good. White clouds, calm seas. On the first trip down to the bottom, divers retrieved a piece of armor plating. Besal studied it but wasn't exactly sure what part of the plane it came from. \"That's a substantial piece of evidence,\" he laughed. \"Maybe Exhibit A in my case of my episode in bad airmanship.\" Much of the debris, now a mix of tires, turbine blades and unrecognizable airplane features, is encrusted with marine life such as coral and sponges. \"You wished the day had turned out different, obviously, than it did, but it is what it is. I was blessed. I was fortunate that nobody else was hurt,\" Besal said. \"I'm glad it happened out here if it had to happen, you know.\" As the day ended and temperatures started cooling off, the blue skies now streaked with purple highlights, Besal, his wife Jennie, Kistel and a dozen other divers, friends and observers returned to shore. Back on land, Besal was still beaming, \"I'll treasure whatever Joe (Kistel) lets me have just as a keepsake of the event. It will certainly cause me to pause and remember that day and again to remember the incredible squadron mates I had and the people that entrusted me with that airplane. I may have broken that trust with the mishap, but they saw fit to trust me again, that's what I'll remember when I look at those (pieces). CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.",

Mark Salter, pictured, had sued Ms Karmel for \u00a350,000 but according to the chef the case was settled for \u00a33,000 . Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Ms Karmel said the case has had a major impact on her life. She said: 'My career depends on my reputation and here he was trying to wreck it. He didn't have a shred of evidence but it has cost me \u00a360,000 to defend my name.' 'I just wanted to curl up and never get up again. I remember going home and collapsing in the hall and weeping. I just felt it couldn't be happy again.' Mr Salter was initially looking for \u00a350,000 in compensation from the renowned celebrity chef. Ms Karmel added: 'I am speaking out because I want to clear my name. I want to get on with my life but I also want to help other people who have suffered from this. There out to be a register of people who have sued companies and why.' The Sunday Telegraph claimed that Mr Salter has had seven jobs over the past decade and taken three legal cases against former employers. The employment tribunal heard claims that Ms Karmel had made sexual comments to Mr Salter. He also said she wore provocative clothing in a bid to seduce him before dismissing him just four months after he joined her firm. Mrs Karmel had tried to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing publication of her name, her company\u2019s name and the name of her former employee. Her legal team argued that her reputation and status as a \u2018well-known media personality\u2019 would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of the case because it involved an\u00a0 allegation of sexual misconduct. Ms Karmel said he was speaking out at this time in a bid to clear her name after the allegations became public . But the Daily Mail successfully\u00a0 challenged the order. Employment judge James Tayler ruled it was \u2018patronising to the British public to assume that they are incapable of understanding that an allegation is just that until it has been proved\u2019. The judge said \u2018the fact that a hearing will involve the airing of information that is personal and embarrassing and engages the qualified right to respect for private and family life\u2019 is not \u2018sufficient to outweigh the principle of open justice\u2019. Mrs Karmel contested all the allegations made at the four-day employment tribunal hearing in central London. Last month she agreed terms with her former sales manager following hours of legal wrangling. He withdrew his claim of sexual misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued through her lawyers, Mrs Karmel said: \u2018Mark Salter has withdrawn his employment tribunal claim and unreservedly retracted the allegations against me. \u2018I have defended his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this matter.\u2019 It has been reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author \u2018only employed good-looking men\u2019 and made inappropriate comments about his good looks in front of clients. In between discussions with her legal team she found time to tweet nutritional advice for babies and young children, urging mothers to \u2018keep food in large chunks\u2019 for youngsters to hold on to. The food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and ready meals. Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son Nicholas\u2019 fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children. Divorced from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a \u00a320million home in one of London\u2019s most sought after districts with film producer partner Stephen Margolis. Her books carry the seal of approval of Great Ormond Street Hospital and she was awarded an MBE in 2006.",

        "article": "A woman who ballooned to size 38 has lost more than 20 stone after getting so fat she was forced to give up riding her beloved horse Rocky. As a teenager Faith Riley, now 42, was a slim size 10 and loved riding horses, competing in eventing, cross-country and shows every weekend. But her weight soared to 33 stone after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to crippling depression and agoraphobia. By the time she was in her thirties, Miss Riley had to give up horse riding altogether. Scroll down for video . Faith Riley, 42, of Warrington, lost 20 stone after realising she was too heavy to ride her horse Rocky . Miss Riley's weight ballooned to 33st (left) after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to depression and agoraphobia, but she managed to slim down to a size 14 (right) through exercising . As a teenager, Miss Riley was a slim size 10 who loved horse riding and competed in shows at weekends . She could no longer work in her job as a cleaner and a horse riding instructor, and hardly ever left the house. After making a firm decision to lose weight, she turned to her horse Rocky to inspire the motivation to exercise. Mrs Riley, of Warrington, said: 'I cut out all the junk food from my diet and decided to get back out there again.' Miss Riley was prescribed contraceptive injections when she was 23 after the pill caused her to experience extreme nausea and migraines. She said: 'In my late teens I was a size 10 but the injection caused me to put on four stone in one month. 'I was horrified. The doctor, who suggested my weight gain was simply down to my diet, sent me to a nutritionist, but I knew I hadn't been eating lots of chocolate or junk food. BEFORE . Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Chips, peas, gravy and an energy drink . Dinner: Lasagne with garlic bread . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . AFTER . Breakfast: Bran flakes . Lunch: Ham salad sandwich . Dinner: \u00a0Grilled chicken and vegetables . Snacks: None . 'After a year of visiting the nutritionist the doctor agreed the injection had been a cause of my weight gain after all. 'By then, I'd stopped taking the injection, but it was already too late. 'My weight had reached the point where I felt I couldn't do anything about it. 'I became extremely depressed and couldn't face leaving the house. 'I had to give up work and couldn't even bare to see friends.' Over the next decade Miss Riley, who was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis - a condition which causes painful periods and abdominal pain, when she was 26. She saw her weight increase to the point where she had to stop riding. She said: 'When I topped 30 stone I had to stop riding. Rocky would have been able to carry me because he was strong, but I was terrified that I would be too much of a burden to him. 'I thought it would have been cruel to ride him so although I was heartbroken I decided to stop riding.' In 2006 Miss Riley attempted suicide. But after reaching her lowest point, following the breakdown of a relationship, she made a lasting decision. She said: 'I was 33 stone and wearing size 38 clothing. 'I spent some time on my own before I decided to get back to being me - the person I was before I became overweight and depressed. 'I knew it would be extremely difficult but I aimed to get back to the size 10 I once was.' Miss Riley (left and right after losing weight) used to gorge on chips, peas and gravy for lunch as well as constantly snacking on crisps and chocolate . Sadly Miss Riley's horse Rocky, who inspired her weight loss, passed away, but she is determined to stay slim . Miss Riley turned to her faithful four-legged companion, Rocky, for the push she needed to make her lifestyle change happen. She said: 'I knew Rocky would always love to go out with me. Although I couldn't ride him, I knew that spending time with him would always be useful to me. 'I put his bridle on and led him along the road for a walk every morning and every evening, without fail, for months. 'Sometimes motorists would pass and make horrible comments, but I didn't care because I knew I was trying my best and making a difference. Now Miss Riley is light enough to sit on a horse . 'I was determined to shed the weight to get back to riding Rocky properly. 'I also completely changed my diet, getting rid of all the high-fat, high cholesterol food and replacing it with high-fibre and healthier options.' Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Riley ate nothing for breakfast, followed by chips, peas and gravy with energy drinks for lunch. Her evening meal was commonly lasagne with garlic bread and she snacked constantly on chocolates and packets of crisps. As part of her healthy-eating regime, Miss Riley began the day with a bowl of bran flakes, followed by a ham salad sandwich for lunch. Her transformed dinners include grilled chicken and vegetables and the 42-year-old has rid her diet of snacks. Today, Miss Riley weighs 12st 8lb and wears size 14 clothing. She has been with her current partner, gardener Paul Bigg, 31, for two years. She said: 'I met Paul when I was still a size 20, and I'm happy to say I've lost even more weight since then. I'm very confident in myself now. 'I know I'll never go back to the bad old days of being overweight and depressed.' Although Rocky died while Miss Riley was on her weight loss journey, she is now looking forward to getting back in the saddle. She said: 'I'm now light enough to sit on a horse and ride without any concerns. I'm currently recovering from knee surgery but as soon as I'm healed I'll be back out riding as regularly as I ever was. 'I have Rocky to thank my weight loss. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be where I am today, and goodness knows what state I'd be in. I owe him everything.'",

        "article": "By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 10:49 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:44 EST, 6 August 2013 . Labour rising star Chuka Umunna was accused of hypocrisy last night for accepting a \u00a320,000 donation from a gambling tycoon after publicly demanding cuts in the number of betting shops. Tories said the shadow\u00a0 business secretary was guilty of double standards for accepting the money from Neil Goulden. Mr Goulden is chairman of the Association of British Bookmakers, the UK trade body and lobbying organisation for the industry. Hypocrisy: Chuka Umunna was accused of double standards for campaigning against betting shops while accepting a \u00a320,000 donation from the boss of Coral . He is also chairman emeritus of the Gala Coral Group, one of Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaking chains, which has two shops in Mr Umunna\u2019s South London constituency. The Streatham MP has run a campaign to stop the spread of bookmakers, acknowledging \u2018huge concern that some streets in our area are steadily filling up with betting shops and payday loan companies that take advantage of our community, rather than help us\u2019. In June his website revealed: \u2018Chuka has developed a Streatham Strategy to help the High Road. It includes a temporary cut in VAT [and] new powers to control the number of betting shops\u2019. Gambling man: Neil Goulden, chairman emeritus of Gala Coral Group, gave the money to run the Labour frontbencher's office . Yet last month he registered the donation to \u2018support the office of Chuka Umunna in his capacity as shadow secretary of state for business, and for staffing\u2019. Earlier this year Mr Umunna was forced to deny doctoring his Wikipedia page to include flattering comparisons with Barack Obama. In April it emerged a change to the entry in 2008, which included a link to a flattering profile of him, had been made from a computer at the law firm where Mr Umunna worked before entering Parliament in 2010. Mr Umunna\u2019s spokesman said the Labour frontbencher had \u2018no recollection\u2019 of changing his Wikipedia page, but offered no explanation of how it had come to be changed from his former place of work. The Daily Mail subsequently revealed that in 2006 Mr Umunna had protested that West End nightclubs \u2018seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes\u2019. Tory party vice-chairman Bob Neill said yesterday: \u2018Can anyone really credibly ever believe anything Chuka Umunna says? 'He says one thing in public and does another behind closed doors. His hypocrisy seems to be limitless. \u2018The only thing we know he truly believes is that the capital is full of \u2018\u2018trash\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018C-list\u2019\u2019 wannabes.\u2019 A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: \u2018This donation was made by an individual Labour Party supporter in a personal capacity, and was accepted in accordance with the rules and properly declared.\u2019",

Bianca Fazey, 24, had a one night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 this year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. For five months, Bianca frantically searched for the father but had no luck as she only knew his first name and what suburb he lived in. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said.

'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca is due in mid January and\u00a0can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.'

        "summary": "The 27th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day is Wednesday .\nIn its 17th year, the WNBA still struggles for fans and sponsorship, says Lisa Leslie .\nLeslie contends playing sports can help deter girls from early pregnancy and drugs .",
        "article": "Atlanta (CNN) -- Basketball star Lisa Leslie battled her way from the courts of Inglewood, California, to the upper echelons of the WNBA to become one of the most popular women's basketball players of all time. After retiring from play, Leslie finds herself in a new fight -- to gain respect for her beloved sport. \"It's a constant battle,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm an activist for women in sports.\" Marking its 17th season this year, the Women's National Basketball Association is the country's longest-running professional women's sports league. But the quest for fans, sponsors and exposure in a sports world dominated by men can be slow, and tough. The league will celebrate the 27th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day on Wednesday, with several community events across the country. The occasion will honor female achievement in sports. But some say U.S. attitudes have a long way to go. How women cracked tennis' glass ceiling . Leslie was one of the pioneer players in the league. During her 12 seasons in the WNBA, she won three Most Valuable Player trophies -- not to mention four Olympic gold medals. She also scored her place in women's basketball history when she became the first professional player to slam dunk during a game back in 2002. Now, as co-owner of her former team, the Los Angeles Sparks, she is looking for a slam dunk in the form of financial support. \"It's difficult to get corporate sponsors to really buy in and spend some of those corporate dollars on women's sports,\" she says. The WNBA says that team sponsorships rose more than 10 percent in 2012 from the prior season. Still, Leslie calls her task tough, even with support from the NBA. Leslie says the women's league is growing, \"but it would be nice to get more fans supporting the WNBA and more women supporting women in sports.\" Top player Tina Charles says there is an unfair attitude toward women's sports in the United States. \"I don't think we get a lot of media coverage the way that I wish we could,\" she says. The center for the Connecticut Sun was the WNBA's MVP last season. Still, speaking to CNN from Krakow, Poland, where she is playing in the offseason, she says she is pleased with the WNBA's progress, and that playing for the league has been a dream come true. \"I think we have a lot to show with the way we play,\" she says. \"...how hard we play, how competitive we are, just to show that there is another avenue for girls, another outlet for girls.\" But building a fan base and profitability takes time. It also takes canny leadership. \"We are in no way resting on our laurels,\" says WNBA President Laurel Richie, who came to the league in 2011 from Girl Scouts of the USA, where she was chief marketing officer. \"But we do take some comfort in the fact that it takes a while to get a league and all teams up and running and to profitability.\" Expanding exposure is another challenge. Richie points to ESPN2's plan to broadcast the WNBA draft in prime time this year. Last year marked the first time ESPN televised the draft lottery at all. Experts agree that watching women play in a professional arena is inspiring for girls. And it helps convince them to play sports themselves -- a huge benefit for their development. \"It's really stunning,\" says Nancy Hogshead-Makar, senior director of advocacy for the Women's Sports Foundation. \"The changes are profound for the rest of [a girl's] life.\" Hogshead-Makar, who won three gold medals as an Olympic swimmer, says playing sports teaches girls about winning and losing, belonging to a team, and postponing short-term gratification for long-term rewards. She says that those skills \"translate directly into tangible educational gains, and economic gains.\" Sports can also help teenagers during an awkward time in their development. Lisa Leslie credits basketball with shaping her character, as well as her career. Analysis: 40 years after Title IX, more women in high school sports . She started playing for a simple reason, she says: \"I wanted to be popular.\" But impressing her classmates was hardly the only benefit. \"I found playing basketball really became the most important aspect of who I am today,\" Leslie says. \"When you play sports, you're more likely not to do drugs, you're more likely not to have early pregnancy.\" WNBA players and executives alike see community outreach as part of the league's mandate. Tina Charles donated $32,000 of her own money to help build a school in Mali. Kelly Loeffler, co-owner and co-chairman of the Atlanta Dream, says she was drawn to the league when she first saw a game. She thought there was a tremendous product, without the recognition it deserved. \"It was the opportunity to solve that business challenge,\" Loeffler says, \"...while being a part of the growing movement towards growth in professional women's sports.\" She credits her players with filling key roles in the community and helping to win fans among girls, and boys. By building awareness, women's sports fans hope to create more support for women on the court. One of the most famous female athletes in the country, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, credits Title IX, a 1972 law barring discrimination in school sports, for creating equal opportunities for girls. \"With Title IX, the opportunity for girls in sports is such a blessing,\" says Joyner-Kersee. \"I can never imagine the women who came before me, who didn't have the same opportunities that I had.\" She broke records with her Olympic heptathlon performances. Now, she reaches out to young people through grassroots programs, like the Triple Play wellness program through the Boys and Girls Clubs. Experts agree the race isn't over for equality in sports, particularly in the coaching industry. Hogshead-Makar says women are locked out of jobs that would have them coaching men at the university and professional levels. \"It's probably the most sex-segregated industry out there,\" she says. \"The industry of coaching men. It's less than 2%.\" Still, she's optimistic about the future. \"(With) those numbers?\" she says. \"You can only go up.\"",

        "article": "By . Sarah Griffiths . Sat-navs are not much use if you want to take a scenic walk around an unfamiliar city at the weekend. While they may be good for getting from A to B in a hurry, the technology is unhelpful at selecting the prettiest routes, which may be of interest if you are not in so much of a rush. But Yahoo is working on an aesthetically-focused solution and is creating an algorithm that can pick out the most beautiful and pleasurable routes, initially based upon the views of locals. Yahoo is creating an algorithm that can pick out the most beautiful and happy of routes, based upon the views of locals. The map on the left shows the most direct route from Euston Square to the Tate Modern, wheres the one on the right, generated by the new algorithm is longer, but more aesthetically pleasing . According to the crowd-sourced exercise, Londoners consider these eight places the most beautiful in the capital. Daniele Quercia, of Yahoo Labs, Barcelona, wrote in a paper: \u2018The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant.\u2019 In order to create the scenic route algorithm, the computer scientists collected images from Google Street View and Geograph to create a database for central London, Gizmodo reported. They then asked 3,300 Londoners how pleasant the places and neighbourhoods were relative to each other. Users saw two places side by side and chose which one was more attractive. \u2018We arranged those locations into a graph upon which we learned pleasant routes,\u2019 Ms Quercia wrote. The team used the results to make heat maps of beautiful parts of London and generated an algorithm to plot the most attractive routes for people to walk along. The algorithm does this by searching through suggested routes from one location to another, manipulating the path to choose the most attractive roads. The computer scientists used crow sourced results to make heat maps of beautiful parts of London - including Millennium Bridge (pictured left) and Covent Garden (right) from which they generated an algorithm to plot the most attractive routes for people to walk along . The researchers said that routes tend to be 12 per cent longer than the shortest paths. When 30 volunteers tested their \u2018attractive\u2019 routes, they confirmed that they were indeed more aesthetically pleasing. \u2018Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet and happy,\u2019 they wrote. To test and build on the idea, the computer scientists then examined almost four million images on Flickr taken in specific London locations that they had already mapped, to understand what is considered beautiful. Knocking out the crowd-sourcing element of the process, the repeated the Flickr process to made a new map of central Boston, pinpointing beauty hotspots and routes. Volunteers who tried them out confirmed that they were more scenic than the most direct routes offered by other software, such as on sat-navs. While one person\u2019s idea of beauty may differ from another, the computer scientists hope to develop an app exploiting their algorithm soon.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A U.S. federal grand jury in Texas has indicted the suspected top leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada Garcia face murder and conspiracy charges connected with drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime. The indictment, returned April 11 and unsealed Tuesday, also charges 22 other people who prosecutors allege are connected with the cartel. It is one of several U.S. federal indictments charging Guzman, who is widely known as Mexico's most wanted fugitive and has made Forbes magazine's list of the world's most powerful people. \"It's a reminder we're right behind him, that he can't live out in the open. We need to get them apprehended,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Franco said Tuesday. This month's indictment in western Texas detailed two acts of violence prosecutors said were committed by members of the cartel, including the 2010 kidnapping of an American citizen and two members of his family during a wedding ceremony in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, because of their ties with the rival Juarez cartel. The target was the groom and a resident of Columbus, New Mexico, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas said in a statement. Police found the bodies of the groom, his brother and his uncle three days after the wedding in the bed of a pickup truck, according to the indictment. The indictment also describes the 2009 kidnapping, killing and mutilation of a Texas resident \"to answer for the loss of a 670-pound load of marijuana seized by the Border Patrol,\" prosecutors said. Investigators found the Texas resident's body in Ciudad Juarez, according to the indictment. \"He had been beaten and strangled and his hands had been severed above the wrists and placed on his chest, to serve as a warning to those who might attempt to steal from the cartel,\" the indictment says. Guzman and Zambada have been indicted on drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a number of U.S. federal courts. U.S. officials have offered a $5 million reward for information leading to their capture. Guzman was arrested in 1993 on homicide and drug charges but escaped in 2001, reportedly by bribing prison guards to smuggle him out in a laundry truck. A Mexican federal investigation led to the arrest of more than 70 prison officials. Forbes magazine has placed him on its list of the world's most powerful people, reporting his net worth of $1 billion as of March. Rumors regularly surge about his whereabouts. Franco declined to comment on whether there was new information regarding Guzman's location. He described Guzman as \"a man who has unlimited means, more money than most people in Mexico.\" \"It affords him the ability to hide,\" Franco added. The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the nation. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Catherine E.

Charter boat captain Jim Sharpe was on his dock in Summerland Key, Florida. last Friday when he noticed a brown pelican with its throat slit, making it almost impossible for it to swallow fish. Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground.

Depraved behavior: A brown pelican was found in the lower Florida Keys with a chunk of its pouch intentionally cut out . Cruelty: Each time the pelican tried to swallow, the ballyhoo would fall out of its large pouch and onto the ground. After about the seventh attempt, Sharpe said, he put a cast net over the water bird and made a gruesome discovery . A 10-inch clean slit reached from the point of the bird\u2019s beak, all the way back to the glottis. 'The windpipe was dangling from the bird\u2019s neck, almost like it was breathing out of a snorkel,' Veterinarian Don Harris, director of the Avian & Exotic Animal Medical Center in Miami, told the Herald. Several more brown pelicans have been turning up in the area with the same injury, and Maya Totman, director of the Florida Keys Wildlife Rescue, said she fears there\u2019s a person or group of people out there doing this to innocent animals. 'We\u2019ve seen a lot of ripped pouches, but never anything like this,' she said. Clean cut: 'It looked like the pelican's throat had been cut with a knife' Sharpe said. And it was not just one clean slice, but two cuts about six inches apart, creating a large hole in the pouch . Rescuer: Captain Jim Sharpe of Sea Boots Charters on Summerland Key found this brown pelican on the dock with a large chunk of its pouch cut out, which prevents it from eating . It's not clear how the bird was maimed but it is possible that the bird was slashed from the inside. Harris agreed that the cuts on the pelican brought in by Sharpe appeared to be intentional. 'I firmly believe it to be malicious,\u201d he told the paper, even likening the lacerations to 'a Colombian necktie' \u2014 in reference to a method of murder that began during the Colombian civil war.

'If we don\u2019t catch them soon they are going to die from starvation a terrible death,' she said. 'This is so sad. So sad.' Multiple occurrences: Several more brown pelicans have been seen in the Lower Keys with the same injury.

Beautiful bird: This is how the Brown Pelican should appear in breeding colors with it's translucent pouch extended . How it should be: Pelicans sit on a sandbar on the beach of the Florida Keys . Doctors help: Veterinarian Don Harris, director of the Avian & Exotic Animal Medical Center in Miami, performed surgery on the pelican that was found .

        "article": "(CNN) -- James Traficant Jr., who railed against government agencies while serving as a wild-haired, maverick congressman from Ohio, died Saturday after being critically injured in a tractor accident on his farm. Traficant was 73. Family attorney Heidi Hanni told CNN that Traficant passed away at 11:30 a.m. He'd been riding a small 1943 tractor on Tuesday at his farm in Greenford, Ohio, when he lost control, causing the tractor to roll over him, local police said. He died at St. Elizabeth Health Center, the Youngstown Vindicator reported. Traficant was a Democrat who represented Ohio's 17th Congressional District from 1985 to 2002. With a penchant for colorful, sometimes crude language, Traficant made a name for himself in Washington long before being convicted on federal corruption charges, a courtroom defeat that led to his expulsion from Congress because of ethics violations tied to it. \"There are no ethics in politics,\" he declared at his ethics hearing. \"And there should be no ethics committee. It is dog eat dog. Castrate your opponent.\" Such comments made him a favorite of reporters in Washington, where he was willing to offer his opinion on just about any topic. 'Beam me up!' He was equally famous in Washington for his hair. The Washington Post obit noted: \"Reporters outdid themselves in trying to describe Mr. Traficant's pompadour -- and to determine whether it was real. In the words of the Los Angeles Times, it was a 'Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet,' or as Washingtonian magazine put it, 'a creature from Lake Erie before it was cleaned up.'\" But it turned out Traficant wore a toupee. This was discovered in 2002 when he was booked into a jail in Akron, Ohio, before being sent to federal prison, and authorities searched for \"contraband or weapons,\" according to a CNN story. A jail official said it was a small hairpiece and didn't fully cover Traficant's head. Traficant made flamboyant and animated House speeches, which often ended with his trademark, \"Beam me up!\" A former football player at the University of Pittsburgh, Traficant went on to play the role of hometown hero after graduation, serving as a drug counselor and Mahoning County, Ohio, sheriff. While sheriff, Traficant was tried on bribery charges in 1983. Acting as his own lawyer, he persuaded a jury to acquit him, saying he was conducting his own sting operation. He was elected to Congress in 1984. In Washington, he barreled through the House in rumpled sports coats and loud shirts. Traficant fashioned himself as a maverick populist, spending much of his career railing against foreign aid and various government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the CIA. \"Lying, thieving, stealing nincompoops\" is how he once described the latter. Convicted of bribery charges . In April 2002, Traficant was convicted on 10 charges of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion. Although not a lawyer, Traficant again represented himself. He was expelled from the House later that year by a 420-1 vote, becoming only the second congressman expelled since the Civil War. He took up painting as a hobby while he served his sentence from 2002 to 2009. Months after his release from prison, Traficant filed for office as an independent but lost his bid to regain his old seat to sitting Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat. A few days before his expulsion from Congress, Traficant told CNN, \"I'm a son of a truck driver. Forget this Congress business, I'm a regular guy.\" People we've lost in 2014 . Parts of this story came from a 2002 CNN profile of James Traficant Jr.",

        "article": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A man accused of taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude through hotel peepholes and posting the videos online will plead guilty to a federal stalking charge, according to a court document filed Thursday. Michael David Barrett, 48, will enter a plea on December 15, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the Central District of California. A criminal complaint filed in October accused Barrett of taping Andrews then making seven videos that he posted on the Internet. Barrett's lawyer, David Willingham, issued a statement saying his client apologized to Andrews. \"Mr. Barrett accepts full responsibility for his conduct. He apologizes to Ms. Andrews, and expresses his deep regret for his conduct that caused her so much pain. It is his sincere hope that these events can now become an opportunity to make positive changes in his life,\" the statement said. Barrett was arrested in Illinois but will appear in Los Angeles federal court, Mrozek said. Barrett is charged with interstate stalking, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. An Illinois judge released Barrett on bail in October. Andrews, 31, is a sideline reporter for ESPN, traveling around the country covering college football games. According to the October criminal complaint, Andrews said that she became aware of the videos in July and that their posting has caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Her lawyer, Marshall Grossman, told CNN that Andrews is still shaken. \"She is a very strong young woman. Time is a good healer,\" Grossman said. \"However, she continues to feel and experience the ramifications of what occurred every time she steps foot into a hotel room, and in her business, she lives in hotel rooms.\" Andrews is now accompanied by additional security, Grossman said. Grossman said he and Andrews are in the process of reviewing the evidence against Barrett and the plea agreement, and Andrews will speak before the court at the hearing next week. He said Andrews wants \"severe punishment\" for Barrett. The plea agreement filed Thursday alleges that Barrett recorded videos of Andrews while she stayed at hotels in Columbus, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Nashville, Tennessee. The filing alleges Barrett made reservations at the hotels and altered the peepholes to shoot video of Andrews. Barrett allegedly attempted to sell the videos to celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. Barrett posted the videos to other Web sites, Thursday's filing said. CNN's Khadijah Rentas and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.",

        "article": "By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 03:41 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 18 February 2013 . WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A woman and her brother-in-law have been charged with the murder of a 20-year-old mother who was tortured and burned to death because villagers believed she was a witch. Janet Ware, 28, and her relative, Andrew Watea, 33, were said by police to have been responsible for burning to death young mother Kepari Leniata in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea earlier this month. The shocking death of Miss Leniata, whom villagers believed had used sorcery to kill the six-year-old son of Miss Watea, made international headlines and prompted a widespread manhunt through the jungles of central Papua New Guinea. Repeat horror: The attack took place in the same town where a young mother was burned alive accused for killing a child through sorcery (pictured) In dawn raids on a number of villages, more than 100 people were detained and questioned about the fiery murder \u2013 and all were released except the two who have now been charged. Provincial police commander Superintendent Martin Lakari told The National newspaper that the pair were charged after \u2018intensive questioning\u2019 of all those rounded up in the raids. Scores of people had gathered at a rubbish tip when Miss Leniata was dragged there, ordered to strip, doused with petrol and set alight. Burning tyres were thrown onto her body as she screamed in pain but police, who had rushed to the area after hearing reports that a \u2018witch\u2019 was to be burned were forced back by the jeering crowd. Miss Leniata was accused by close relatives of the dead boy of using sorcery to bring about his death. He had complained of severe stomach pain and died later in hospital. Villagers claimed that Miss Leniata had confessed under torture of using sorcery against the boy, but there was no evidence of this. Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands . Superintendent Lakari said that hours after Miss Ware and her brother-in-law were arrested, police charged a villager with the torture of two elderly women who were accused by locals of practising sorcery. The women, who had been tied to posts, were rescued by police shortly before they, too, were about to be burned alive. \u2018We are not finished from here,\u2019 said the superintendent. \u2018We are continuing investigations into these cases and if any evidence or reports come in later saying that other people involved are still at large, we will also arrest them.\u2019 The young mother was tossed screaming on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive after being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery. Kepari Leniata, 20, was said to have 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with white-hot iron rods. She was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres. As the mother-of-two screamed in agony, more petrol-soaked tyres were thrown on top of her. The tragedy unfolded after Miss Leniata's . young neighbour fell sick earlier this month. He complained of pains in . the stomach and chest and was taken to Mt Hagen hospital where he died a . few hours later. Scene: The two women had been tied to poles and were about to be burned alive when police arrived in Mount Hagen . Relatives of the boy were suspicious . that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had . gone into hiding in the jungle. After they were tracked down, the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy's death. Miss Lanieta, they said, was the person responsible. The boy's family went to her hut at 7am on Wednesday, stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death. Pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online. The . Post Courier newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of . two \u2018provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers, including . school children, who crowded around and took photos of the woman being . consumed alive by the fire.\u2019 Police who rushed to the area were . turned back by the angry crowd, but were able to drive away with one of . the other women while the second has fled. Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture) Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages . Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (\u00a3303), plus a pig and a bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by \u2018kangaroo courts\u2019 made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019 convicted him of sorcery. A firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd. Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, leaves behind two children, the youngest an eight-month-old girl. The country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill had promised to bring the killers to justice. \u2018No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said. \u2018Barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country. 'It is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with.\u2019 The U.S. embassy on the Papua New Guinea issued a statement condemning the \"\u2019brutal murder\u2019 calling it evidence of \u2018pervasive gender-based violence\u2019. \u2019We add our voice to those of Papua New Guinean religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon Ms Lanieta,\u2019 the embassy said. \u2018There is no possible justification for this sort of violence. We hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying, prosecuting, and punishing those responsible for Ms Lanieta's murder.\u2019",

        "summary": "The Coalition pledged nobody will pay care costs above \u00a372,000 .\nBut new report claims the 'cap' is full of hidden charges .\nInstitute and Faculty of Actuaries claim real costs will be twice as much .",
        "article": "Published: . 19:32 EST, 11 May 2014 . | . Updated: . 09:56 EST, 12 May 2014 . Pensioners who require long-term care could end up paying double the much-vaunted cap on costs because there are so many hidden charges, a report claims. The Coalition has pledged that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than \u00a372,000 \u2013 with the state stepping in to foot the bill after that. But the pledge does not cover the full bill for elderly care. Cap: The Coalition said that the cost of care would be capped at \u00a372,000 . Among the costs not included in the cap is the \u2018bed and board\u2019 bill for living in a care home, which can exceed \u00a310,000 a year. Now the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries has found that these hidden charges mean people will shell out an average of \u00a3140,000 before they reach the level of the cap. Their research also found that only around one in ten pensioners will ever reach the point of receiving help from the state \u2013 the majority will have to bear the full costs themselves. They concluded that the cap has been set so high that only around 8 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women who enter care will ever reach it. Thomas Kenny, one of the authors of the report, said: \u2018Anyone who is expecting that the cap will pay for care is in for a shock. \u2018The cap is there to protect against catastrophic costs, and we estimate that few people entering care aged 85 years will reach it.\u2019 Warning: Dr Ros Altmann, a former government adviser, warned that people still need to save to provide for their old age . The Coalition has pledged to end England\u2019s care crisis, which can see the elderly facing unlimited care costs \u2013 leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year. The cap, which will come into force in 2016, will be set at \u00a372,000 and will cover nursing in care homes or the cost of home helps. After this level, the state will step in and pay the rest. However, it will not cover a range of costs such as bed and board, or help for those whose needs are not deemed to be \u2018substantial\u2019 by the council. People will also pay extra if they do not want to live the type of \u2018bog standard\u2019 home a local authority would fund. The study found that once these hidden charges are factored in, people would have spent an average of \u00a3140,000 by the time they reach the so-called cap of \u00a372,000. Mr Kenny said many people would still have to dip into the money locked up in their property to pay for care. \u2018Recent research data shows that one in three women and one in four men aged 65 today is likely to need care,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yet the average disposable income for retired households was \u00a318,700 in 2011/12, which is below the level required to fund average long-term care costs before reaching the cap.\u2019 He said that, even with the cap, people would have to save through their lives to pay for care, and called on more people to take out pension plans which include a care element. 'With the right tax incentives and flexibility, there are products that could help people to meet any care needs that they may have in the future,\u2019 said Mr Kenny. Although the average person is expected to spend around \u00a3140,000 on care costs before reaching the cap, this can increase to some \u00a3250,000 if a person is in care for 10 years. There are also significant regional variations in the costs and the amount of time it will take for the cap to apply. In London, someone entering a care home aged 85 is expected to reach it in four years and incur a personal cost of \u00a3117,000 before reaching it. In the West Midlands however, it will take seven years to reach the cap with a personal cost of \u00a3170,000. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on older people, said: \u2018The government is not going to cover the care costs for most people. Even with the cap, most people will still end up paying all their costs. \u2018People are not putting money aside but they need to, because society cannot afford all the older people coming through. \u2018We will all be affected by this. We need to make provision \u2013 the state won\u2019t cover it.\u2019 Last night a spokesman for the Department of Health said: \u2018We are introducing the first ever cap on care to protect people from catastrophic costs and deferred payments so no one should be forced to sell their home in their lifetime. \u2018Our reforms will mean that more people will get financial help sooner.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A 30-year-old dolphin at Sea World has died after colliding with another dolphin while performing aerial tricks, the Orlando, Florida, amusement park said Monday. The incident occurred about 4:30 p.m. Saturday at the Discovery Cove area of the park, according to a statement by Sea World spokeswoman Becca Bides. The animals were in the center of the lagoon and not near guests, she said. The dolphin who died was named Sharky. The other dolphin, Tyler, is being watched by veterinarians but appears to be fine, Bides said. \"This is an unfortunate, random incident,\" Bides said in a written statement. \"While it is not unusual to have two animals performing aerial behaviors at the same time, we are reviewing the situation to ensure even such a random incident does not occur again.\" E-mail to a friend .",

        "article": "(Wired) -- Walking into one of Yayoi Kusama's infinity rooms is like walking into a completely different universe. The door shuts behind you, and suddenly you find yourself surrounded by what appears to be a galaxy of shimmering LEDs. The scene is beautiful, in a surreal, space-age fairy tale sort of way. But it's also a little jarring in its intimacy; it's almost as though you've been instantly transported from a whitewashed gallery into Kusama's buzzing, obsessive mind. It's a strange place to inhabit, if only because you get the sense that what goes on inside Kusama's mind is very different than what's happening inside, say, your neighbor's, or your colleague's. The Japanese artist has lived in a Japanese mental institution since the 1970s, when she checked herself in after a particularly stressful stint in New York City. But Kusama's struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and other mental anguishes is not a shameful secret. In fact, it's the opposite. Read more: Wildly detailed drawings that combine math and butterflies . Kusama's mental woes fuel her work, with her obsession and compulsion manifested in her exaggerated use of shapes, colors and mirrored rooms. For as long as Kusama has been an artist (she's currently in her mid-80s), she's been obsessed with polka-dots. A result of hallucinations she's had since childhood, the shapes are plastered across her paintings, on her clothes, and incorporated into her trippy infinity rooms. It's not hyperbole to say they are everywhere. Including her newly opened show at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York City. In \"I Who Have Arrived in Heaven\", Kusama continues the motif with 27 new paintings and two infinity rooms, all covered in dots of varying shapes and sizes. The colorful large-scale paintings covered in eyes and dots are beautiful works in their own right, but the real reason most people will trek to the Chelsea gallery and wait in the 4-hour line is to see Kusama's brilliant mirrored infinity rooms. GIZMODO - Infinity Rooms from Gizmodo on Vimeo. Kusama has been making these magical boxes since the 1960s, when she first lined a small room with mirrors and filled it with polka-dotted phallic shapes, creating what I like to imagine a brothel in the Dr. Seuss universe might look like. Her newest room, \"The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away,\" is more along the lines of her beloved \"Fireflies on the Water,\" a mirrored infinity room that showcased hundreds of warm-hued LEDs at the Whitney last year. Read more: Mind-blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins . In her new room, Kusama has again suspended multi-colored LEDs from the ceiling at varying lengths that reflect off of the mirrored walls and shallow pool on the floor in a strobe light pattern that repeats itself every 45 seconds. Just down the street at the gallery's connected space is another infinity room, \"Love Is Calling, which this time is filled with brightly colored inflatable sculptures covered in polka dots that shoot up from the floor and hang from the ceiling like technicolor tentacles. The artist says the kaleidoscopic rooms are her attempt to investigate life, death and infinity, and if you're prone to existential pondering, it's easy to see that connection. Contemplating the infinite does have a way of drudging up those \"what's it all mean?\" feelings. But for most people, being inside Kusama's glimmering universe is simply a brief reprieve from a dulled world they left on the other side of the door. For a moment, you can almost forget about the line waiting outside, the 360 degrees of mirrors and ultimately, yourself. But just for a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbecause there's no way you're leaving without taking a selfie. I Who Have Arrived in Heaven will be at David Zwirner through December 21 .

        "summary": "5 million records stored in two warehouses and his home .\nBus magnate Zero Freitas began collecting as a boy .\nNow he is working on making the huge collection available to the public .",
        "article": "Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Strolling between shelves crammed with his records, Zero Freitas pauses and finds another piece of music that he just must take home. He is walking through a warehouse where there are about 250,000 records. The room seems to stretch away with his records but it is only a fraction of the collection. Most of his five million records are in a former candle factory nearby, and another 100,000 are kept in his home -- for personal listening. Freitas pulls from the shelf a copy of \"The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker.\" \"Marvelous,\" he chuckles. \"This is rare. I'm going to have to take it home.\" Which is a problem of sorts. Freitas is trying to consolidate and catalog his massive vinyl collection, but every day he ends up finding some treasure or other that he sneaks out of the cataloging collection and off to his private stockpile at home. \"What I have at home is what I have mined over the course of my life,\" Freitas tells CNN at his warehouse in Sao Paulo. \"These days, it's things that appear out of nowhere, that I didn't even know I was looking for.\" Freitas, 62, calls himself \"a hunter of lost sound.\" He is a Brazilian bus magnate whose obsession has turned him into the owner of the largest known record collection in the world -- an estimated five million singles, albums and old 78s. \"Everyone thinks I'm obsessed with albums,\" he says. \"But really it's an obsession with memory and history, of Brazil and all of human kind.\" For years he bought records -- sometimes individual albums and sometimes entire vinyl collections -- unnoticed. In high school, he already had 3,000 and by the time he was 30 he had amassed roughly 30,000 albums. A recent agreement with Brazilian authorities has allowed him to import whole shipping containers full of aging records and his collection has ballooned. When major international collectors or iconic shops like New York's Colony Records sold off their stockpiles, nobody really knew where they were going. But earlier this month, the New York Times revealed that Freitas was the eclectic buyer behind many of the transactions. \"Now I'm being hunted,\" Freitas laughs. He says most of the interest has come from sellers, but also from people searching for an obscure piece of music. He says: \"90 percent of the time, people are looking for something from their childhood. It's often culturally irrelevant music, but for that person extremely important. Freitas now wants to make his records available to the public as early as next year -- in a kind of listening library that he'll call a Musical Emporium. He has hired 17 interns to help him. Most of them history students. Wearing plastic gloves and surgical masks, they clean and dust the vinyl discs, photograph the covers and painstakingly catalog each album. They get through about 500 records a day and have so far cataloged about 250,000. A drop in the bucket. Freitas thumbs through some of the records from his personal collection that he brought in to show us: \"Wedding Album\" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono; a signed copy of Duke Ellington's \"New Orleans Suite;\" and not one, but four copies of the first album made by Brazilian crooner, Roberto Carlos, \"Louco por Voce.\" \"Just the other day, we found an autographed Arthur Rubinstein that I didn't even know existed!\" he says, referring to the classical American pianist. But one of his most treasured discoveries, he says, is a rare recording of soprano Bidu Sayao, signed by the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Freitas bought it on eBay for one dollar.",

        "article": "The Duchess of Cambridge's announcement today puts an end to months of pregnancy speculation. Number Two is on the way and with him or her comes a huge boost for the Royal Family. The level of excitement won't quite be the same as it was for Prince George -- but we can still expect great interest across the world and massive baby fever early next year. But why does the \"spare heir\" matter? One child is never enough for a monarch. Throughout history, the only way to secure a throne has been with a phalanx of children -- nine for Victoria, thirteen for George III. Aristocratic wives were once told they needed to provide an \"heir and a spare\" at least -- and the same has always been true for the royals. Once, this was because high mortality rates meant that the more children the better -- for the first born son didn't always come to be King. Henry VIII was the second son, who became heir and ascended at 17 after the untimely death of his brother, Arthur. George V was also the second son -- and also became heir after his elder brother died young from influenza. Both men married the women who'd been betrothed to their brothers -- Henry made Catherine of Aragon his queen and George wed Mary of Teck. The current Queen's father, George VI, was the second son of George V, and was never meant to be king. But when his elder brother, Edward VIII, gave up the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallace Simpson, the heir became the king -- much to his own surprise. Now we don't expect the second child will come to rule, but he or she still has a vital role in carrying out royal duties and obligations. The Royal Family - or \"Firm,\" as the current royals like to call it -- needs plenty of employees for the huge number of royal visits and receptions. What is different in 2014 is that the heir and the spare heir can be female. After the law changed last year to allow women the same rights of accession to the throne as men, females are no longer pushed to the back of the line. If the Duchess of Cambridge's baby is a girl, she will be the next in line to the throne after her brother -- even if more sons follow. This baby will be a huge boost to the Royal Family - and \"Brand Windsor\" across the world. But what will his or her life be like? The role of the second-in-line is not easy. For Princess Margaret being younger sister of the heir was no picnic -- she had all of the downsides of being royal, such as lack of privacy and restrictions on freedom, without the great compensation of becoming Queen. Unable to find a role for herself or marry the man she loved, the Princess sank into depression and ill health. Prince Harry, too, has been clear on how hard it is to find an occupation -- he was eager to fight on the frontline in Afghanistan but was accidentally exposed by Australian media and had to return. It's also been hard for him to find a woman who will take on the royal role. \"Royals are only private in the womb,\" said the governess of Elizabeth II. We are fascinated by royal children -- most of all by the second or the \"spare heir.\" What will be even more difficult for this second child is that he or she will grow up in a world of camera phones and social media, where private photos are gold dust and royals are the biggest celebrity big game of all. The life of the second child can be exciting and dynamic -- but most of all it is one of extreme fame -- and a lot of responsibility.",

        "summary": "Online news stories falsely claimed some celebrities had died .\nThe rash of fake celebrity news followed Michael Jackson's death last week .\nSome say social media fanned the flames of the rumors .\nFounder of a fakeawish.com claims indirect responsibility for several rumors .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- After a string of real celebrity deaths last week, the Internet and online social networks killed a few more stars. Pop star Britney Spears was among those falsely claimed to be dead recently. Despite what you may have read, Jeff Goldblum, Natalie Portman, George Clooney, Britney Spears, Harrison Ford and Rick Astley are alive. Fake news of their deaths flew across the Internet -- particularly on online social networks like Twitter and Facebook -- after Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Ed McMahon were reported dead. The situation is calling attention to the changing state of the news media: As information online moves faster and comes from more sources, it's more difficult to verify what's true and what may be shockingly false. Some have downplayed the situation, saying the rumors are not harmful. Others find the situation offensive in light of the actual deaths last week. Internet-savvy readers can tell the difference between fake news and real information that has been verified by a trusted blogger or mainstream news reporter, said Gabriel Snyder, managing editor at Gawker, a celebrity news and gossip blog not associated with the rumors. \"It's easier than ever to publish stuff, and the human condition is a complicated thing. Some people just like to be responsible for starting something,\" he said, noting that the trend is not especially new. Others say the fake deaths, or \"death pranks,\" show an inherent problem with the decentralization of news on the Internet. The man who claims indirect responsibility for several of the recent fake celebrity deaths is Rich Hoover, whose site, fakeawish.com, allows users to input celebrity names into five false news templates with outlandish stories about their deaths. Hoover said the site's fans used its story-generation power to start rumors that Goldblum, Ford, Portman and Clooney had died. Traffic on his site jumped from a few thousand users per day to about 500,000 in the two days after Michael Jackson's death, he said. A fake story that appears to have been generated by the site claimed that Portman had died after falling off a cliff in New Zealand. But while a small disclaimer tells readers the story is false, Hoover said many Twitter and Facebook users re-post links after reading only a story headline. \"I'm absolutely flabbergasted by the success of this and the impact these social networks have on communication -- and the communication of misinformation,\" he said. About 85 percent of the recent traffic on Hoover's site came from Facebook and Twitter, he said, adding that the traffic does help him make money. CNN could not independently verify that the celebrity rumors started from Hoover's site. CNN's user-generated news community, iReport.com, was criticized for spreading celebrity death rumors following Michael Jackson's death. One of the site's users sent in a post saying Astley had died. That false news about the singer of \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" was not aired on CNN or CNN.com, both of which vet iReports for accuracy before using them in reporting. For pop star Spears, the recent false news came across Twitter, a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages. After a post said Spears had died, a correction was posted to her Twitter feed on Sunday, saying \"Britney's Twitter was just hacked. The last message is obviously not true. She is fine and dandy spending a quiet day at home relaxing.\" News surrounding deaths is very sensitive and must be correct, said Elaine Haney, president of tributes.com, an obituary site that verifies deaths, often through funeral homes, before posting. \"You never want to kill somebody by accident,\" she said. She added, \"I don't think there's much good to say about somebody who would joke about something serious like that. It's unfortunate.\" The fake news may not be all bad for celebrities. Goldblum, for example, went on Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\" to dispel rumors that he had died. In the episode, host Stephen Colbert jokes that he thinks Goldblum is dead even as the actor appears on stage beside him. Goldblum then posts to Twitter to try to prove that he is still living. \"Oh my God! Ladies and gentlemen, I have huge news,\" Colbert says, upon reading Goldblum's tweet on his phone. \"The dead can Twitter.\" Goldblum then reads his own false obituary into the camera.",

        "article": "It seems that McDonald's has finally realized how tone-deaf its internal employee resource website was. It has shut it down. The final straw? A tip on the site to employees to avoid McDonald's fare. A graphic on the site shows a meal with a cheeseburger, fries and drink under the caption \"Unhealthy choice.\" Next to it is a picture of a sub, a salad and water under the caption \"Healthier choice.\" The latest embarrassment is among a string that's cropped up since the McResource Line website went live. A McResource budget-planning guide for its employees was ridiculed in July for being out of touch. \"For starters, it didn't account for food and gasoline,\" CNNMoney reported. \"The second line on the sample budget leaves room for income from a second job, which many called an admission by the fast food giant that its workers can't live on its wages alone.\" And then earlier this month, NBC News reported that the site offered a guide on how much one should tip a pool cleaner, housekeeper, and even an au pair. The only problem: The University of California Berkeley Labor Center and University of Illinois released a study in October that said 52% of families of fast food workers receive assistance from a public program like Medicaid, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The fast food giant found itself again having to deflect unwanted attention from its internal site this week after CNBC reported that McResource ostensibly advises McDonald's employees to not eat at McDonald's. \"Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight.\" Visitors to McResource Line on Wednesday were greeted with this statement: \"We are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible. Please excuse us while these upgrades are being made.\" McDonald's confirmed the site had been taken down in a statement posted on its website. \"A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we've directed the vendor to take down the website. Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary.

        "summary": "Entrepreneur opened up the small hotel using memorabilia from Hong Kong's Occupy Central protests .\nFor as little as $10 per night, guests can pay to sleep in an original occupy tent .\n11-week-long pro-democracy protests captured the imagination of people around the world .",
        "article": "Hong Kong (CNN)The face of Hong Kong's chief executive covers the toilet paper and China's leader lingers next to you in the shower. Safe to say -- it's not your average hotel. Tucked away in an apartment building on a quiet side street of Hong Kong's busy Causeway Bay district, this small hotel is a shrine to the Umbrella Revolution. Freelance translator Stephen Thompson rented the apartment in early December, in the same week that police began clearing out the city's pro-democracy protest sites. \"I literally got the keys and then the next day I went down to Admiralty (the main protest site) and the police were coming and I just grabbed as much as I could,\" says Thompson. Posters, artwork and memorabilia from all three main protest sites now plaster every inch of the 600 square foot abode. Rows of construction helmets are mounted neatly on the wall, gas masks hang like ornaments around a door frame, newspaper clippings wallpaper the kitchen and a yellow umbrella serves a partial curtain, shielding the living room from the sun. \"I had the idea at first of an exhibition,\" Thompson says, \"and then when they (police) gave me the tents I thought, well, I'll put the tents in here too.\" And the idea for Occupy Central Hotel was born. For as little as HK$78 ($10) per night, guests can pay via a listing on Airbnb to sleep in an original occupy tent. The two-bedroom apartment accommodates a total of eight, Thompson says, but five is the most he's rented at once. Each tent is adorned with a name relating to the movement, such as \"Freedom House\" and \"Foreign Force HQ.\" Nicholas Watmough, 26, followed the Hong Kong protests from his hometown of Manchester, England, and recently extended his visit at the hotel. \"I had a look online. There are cheaper places to stay, but I thought this would just be more interesting. It's an experience worth having and it's a cause worth supporting,\" says Watmough. Visitors from Ukraine, France, and Mexico round out some of the hotel's other recent occupants. Thompson says he has also hosted guests from mainland China, but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed Communist rule. Originally from London, Thompson describes himself as a \"white-skinned Chinese dissident.\" A fluent Mandarin speaker and writer, he spent three decades in and out of China before the government threatened to revoke his visa for writing politically critical articles. He has been living in Hong Kong for eight years now -- and hoping to gain permanent residency soon. \"I feel Hong Kong is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in China,\" he says, which is why he found the 11-week-long, pro-democracy demonstrations so inspirational. Victor Gaume, 29, watched the Occupy movement with interest from afar. He says the Chinese university where he teaches French and history forbade him to come to Hong Kong to see the protests in person, which is why he is now staying at the hotel. \"It's always good to have people like Stephen who keep the memory,\" Gaume says. \"In China, students don't know what happened in (the Tiananmen Square incident in) 1989, because all the memories have been deleted.\" Preserving the memory and keeping the democracy movement alive is something the 50-year-old Thompson says he is passionate about. However, the Hong Kong Home Affairs Department requires anyone running a guesthouse to apply for a special permit from the Office of the Licensing Authority -- something Thompson says he doesn't need to do, because he is selective about who he allows to stay. Despite questions over the legality of his venture, Thompson says he hopes to eventually open up two more Occupy-themed hotels - one for each of the main protest sites. Until then, pro-democracy supporters can continue reliving the protests in a tiny Causeway Bay apartment - having their own movement against Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung, one flush at a time.",

The commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not know how many government soldiers had been killed, but said it would help rebels break into the base, which has been used for attacks in the surrounding province of Idlib. 'Another attack like this and we won't even need to move in to take the base,' he said via Skype, adding that once rebels take the base they would control all of the south Idlib, which is situated in Syria's northwest bordering on Turkey. The tactics mirror those employed during trench warfare in World War One when specialist miners would dig tunnels under No Man's Land to plant explosives beneath enemy lines.

The paper said they identified their captors as men charged with providing them with safe passage to the border. After the fixer and Mr Hill tried to escape, Mr Loyd was shot to prevent him trying to do the same. The paper said that they were released after the Islamic Front, an anti-extremist rebel group, confronted the gang. After Mr Loyd was treated in a local hospital the two reporters and their fixer made it across the border to Turkey. A source who handled their extraction told The Times: 'They [the captors] had dollar signs in their eyes when they realised they had two western journalists. 'What they did not anticipate was loads of the Islamic Front turning up on their doorstep to get them back.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Tokyoites may brag about having the most Michelin stars in the world, but Hong Kongers can actually eat in theirs without breaking the bank. Unveiled last week, the 2015 Michelin guide to Hong Kong and Macau awards 75 restaurants with its coveted stars -- 64 in Hong Kong and 11 in Macau. Bo Innovation, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Lung King Heen, 8 \u00bd Otto e Mezzo-Bombana, Sushi Shikon, Robuchon au Dome (Macau) and The Eight (Macau) are once again crowned with three Michelin stars. (All restaurants in this story are located in Hong Kong unless otherwise indicated.) But what makes Hong Kong special are the prices -- Hong Kong and Macau are among the most affordable Michelin lists in the world -- and variety. \"The selection in the 2015 guide also shows to what extent Hong Kong is increasingly attractive to young foreign chefs, more and more of whom are moving to the city,\" said Michelin in a statement accompanying the release of the guide. \"Hong Kong has become an undisputed leader in the international culinary landscape.\" Starred cheap eats . Hong Kong Michelin guide mainstay Tim Ho Wan (9-11 Fuk Wing St., Sham Shui Po; +852 2788 1226) has long been known as the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world. The humble establishment has now expanded to three branches and all receive one-star status in the 2015 guide. A dim sum meal at Tim Ho Wan can easily cost less than $12. After losing its place in the guide last year, Ho Hung Kee (Shop 1204-05, 12/F, Hysan Place, 500 Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay; +852 2577 6060), celebrated for its $8 wonton noodle, returns in the 2015 guide with one star. Serving roasted goose noodle for about $8, Yat Lok (34-38, Stanley St., Central; +852 2524 3882) advanced from the Bib Gourmand list to a one-star Michelin pick. Newbies on the list . There are 15 new entries in the guide. Some are also new to Hong Kong. Notable newbs include Seasons (one star), helmed by former executive chef of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon; and Olivier Elzer, open only since June (Shop 308, 3/F, Phase 2, Lee Garden, 2-38 Yun Ping Road, Causeway Bay; +852 2505 6228). Another new one-star entry is NUR (3/F, 1 Lyndhurst Tower, Lyndhurst Terrace, Central; +852 2871 9993), which opened in April. Chef Nurdin Topham says the secret to snatching a star so quickly is differentiating itself from competitors. \"We are committed to finding local products from producers in the region and working with the best local farmers, which may be in contrast to other restaurants,\" says Topham. \"(Our) delivery cost is four times higher than normal.\" Topham says many ingredients take only 48 hours at the most to go from the farm to NUR's tables. Local celeb restaurateur Hardy Kam may have lost control of his renowned family restaurant Yung Kee -- after losing a high-profile court case involving the Kam brothers -- but his new eatery, Kam's Roast Goose (G/F, Po Wah Commercial Center, 226 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai; +852 25201110), was also awarded one star.

        "summary": "The gun control group will focus on electing gun safety advocates to office .\nEverytown for Gun Safety will become the umbrella for other gun control groups .\nThe effort will target 15 states .\nMoms and voters are the key outreach demographic .",
        "article": "Michael Bloomberg is investing a chunk of his personal fortune to minimize the influence of the National Rifle Association. The former New York City mayor pledged $50 million to his new group Everytown for Gun Safety, an umbrella organization for his two other gun control groups: Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. It aims to make the political climate more supportive of gun control. The new organization plans to compete against the NRA by adopting its playbook. The NRA has built an impressive and effective organization that touts millions of members, a robust lobbying organization and a massive campaign arm. \"You've got to work at it piece by piece,\" Bloomberg told the The New York Times. In its grass-roots operation, Everytown plans to increase its membership from 1.5 million to 2.5 million this year to implement its education and mobilization efforts. The group will focus on 15 states that have liberal gun laws, including Texas, Montana and Indiana. States that have advanced gun control initiatives will also receive attention, including Colorado and Washington. Bloomberg says no, again, to 2016 . \"The NRA should be afraid,\" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action. Women, and more particularly mothers, will be the key demographic in the outreach to curb gun violence. \"Moms are afraid that our children will be taken away. In the end, that's the emotion that's going to win.\" But influencing those in charge of writing gun policy will be the ultimate goal of the organization, which is also creating a political action committee to elect gun safety candidates to office and a 501(c)(4), an IRS classification used to raise unlimited amounts of money to influence voters. It aims to motivate a million pro-gun safety voters to go to the polls in November. In addition, like the NRA, the organization will submit a gun safety questionnaire to candidates and keep a score card of how elected officials vote on gun-related issues. \"If the candidate doesn't support gun reform, we won't support you,\" Watts said. With an infusion of cash from Bloomberg, matching the NRA's financial heft will be a little less daunting. The NRA has spent more than $30 million lobbying elected officials since 1998. Its efforts have been very successful in Congress over the past decade, defeating attempts to ban assault weapons and expand background checks. On the electioneering side of the influence game, the NRA's political action committee has spent nearly $150 million on campaigns since 1990. Already in the first two months of this midterm election year, the powerful gun group raised $14 million, according to public data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. President of Everytown, John Feinblatt, said the group's 34,000 donors will also play a critical role in rivaling the NRA. \"I don't want to lay blame anywhere, but it is a reality that the gun lobby has an incredible amount of political influence with members of Congress in Washington,\" Mark Kelly, a prominent gun control advocate, told CNN in December. Kelly's wife is former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was severely wounded in a shooting in Arizona in 2011. \"I mean, it's very clear that many members take their cues on this issue from the gun lobby,\" he said. The NRA has little to say about Bloomberg's pledge, for now. \"See you in Indianapolis next week. We'll have a lot more to say then,\" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN. He was referring to the group's annual conference, which takes place next week in Indianapolis. Bloomberg's activism for gun safety increased after repeated mass shootings. His efforts to expand background checks after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School failed to pass either the House or the Senate, despite pressure from the Obama administration. The organization wants to expand background checks, keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, crack down on gun trafficking and educate parents about the safe storage of guns.",

        "article": "A 70-year-old man in Washington D.C. has spent more than 40 years locked away in a D.C. hospital for the criminally insane. His crime: stealing a necklace worth $20. Franklin H. Frye was sent to the psychiatric wing of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 1971 after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity for stealing the necklace. Six years ago, a public defender filed a motion asking a federal court to grant Mr. Frye an unconditional release. In the motion, attorneys for Mr. Frye cited his recovery over the last four decades he spent in psychiatric captivity as grounds for his release. Frye's case, however, is yet to be heard by a judge. Psych ward: Franklin Frye has spent more than 40 years in the St. Elizabeth's psychiatric facility for stealing a $20 necklace . In what the Washington Times - which broke the story about Mr. Frye after reviewing his case and federal court records - describes as 'a serious judicial breakdown,' Mr. Frye's case seems to have slipped through the cracks. According to the paper, the original judge assigned to Mr. Frye's case died in 2007 - when the motion for Mr. Frye's release was first filed. The case wasn't transferred to a judge who is still breathing until the last few weeks. 'Mr. Frye has been waiting over five years to have this motion heard by . the court,' Silvana Naguib, a lawyer now representing him, wrote in a . Jan. 8 legal filing. 'Mr. Frye was accused of stealing a necklace that was valued at approximately twenty dollars,' Ms. Naguib continued in the motion. 'He has been at St. Elizabeth's Hospital almost continuously since.' Glacial pace: Frye's most recent motion for his release was filed six years ago - but is yet to be heard by a judge . Like St. Elizabeth's Hospital's most famous resident, John Hinckley Jr. - the man who infamously shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981 - Mr. Frye has been permitted to spend short amounts of time out of the hospital. Until December, he was part of an outpatient program at Washington Hospital Center. That program ended because of funding problems - and Mr. Frye was sent back to the psychiatric ward. Frye has filed several motions for his release over the last 40 years, including one two years after he was committed. In that motion, the hospital director recommended that Mr. Frye be unconditionally released. The judge, however, approved a conditional release so Mr. Frye could look for a job. 'In the early years of Mr. Frye\u2019s hospitalization, Mr. Frye would sometimes get in fights with other patients, often over money, food, clothing and the other hotly desired commodities of institutional life,' Ms. Naguib wrote in her motion. 'However, in the last decade, as Mr. Frye has aged, these conflicts have all but vanished. Now, nearly 70, Mr. Frye displays no dangerous behavior of any kind.' Infamous: John Hinckley, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan, is also held at St. Elizabeth's Hospital . In his latest motion, Mr. Frye's attorneys reiterate the claims made in the 2008 motion that was never heard by a judge: 'Mr. Frye has recovered his sanity and no longer suffers from a mental illness as defined by law.' Just one day after Naguib filed the most recent motion on Frye's behalf, his case was transferred to a living judge. It's unclear when - or if - the judge will rule on the motion for Mr. Frye's release.",

        "article": "By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 05:35 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:35 EST, 7 January 2014 . This is the first picture of a woman, Nari, believed to have been murdered by fugitive Briton Stuart Green . A British man wanted in connection with a murder in Cambodia is said to have been arrested. Stuart Green, from Eccles, Manchester, is accused of slashing the throat for a local woman at a Phnom Penh hotel. The news of his arrest was reported on an online expatriate forum, which gave details of where 47-year-old Green is said to have been staying after checking out of the hotel where the body of a woman, known locally as Nari, was found. According to a writer using the pseudonym JimmyChina, Stuart was arrested in a guest house located behind an establishment called the Lone Brothers Bikers Bar, used as the headquarters of an expatriate motor cycle club. In broken English, JimmyChina wrote: \u2018He will stay long time in prison - not think he will live long inside that place of prison. (sic)' \u2018Now you can be happy your fellow countryman found. (sic)' he added . British expatriates writing on the forum made it clear they did not want to be associated with Green, responding that he was no fellow countrymen of theirs. Green had checked into the \u00a312-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in Phnom Penh with a Cambodian woman on Christmas Day. A photo, posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name Ross, said the woman was named Nari and was 'a nice girl'. Police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman. He went to the reception desk at around 11pm on December 28, asking for his passport to be returned so he could go to a bank and get money to pay for his room. Even though banks are not open at that time, the passport was returned, Green walked out - and did not come back. The following day a cleaner found the naked body of the young woman under the bed, her throat slashed and a number of other knife wounds in her neck. Expatriates on the online forum has been speculating that Green might have been able to cross a 'loosely-guarded' border into a neighbouring country - most likely Thailand. Others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote 'flophouse' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him. Cambodian police said a woman aged about 20 had been found in a room at the Bolyna Palace Hotel . A cleaner found the blood-covered  body of the woman under a bed inside the Cambodian hotel . If the dead woman is indeed Nari, she appears to have been liked by a number of expatriates. One writer commented: 'I didn't know her and I wish she'd had a different lifestyle and life opportunities, but I do hope they capture the bastard who killed her.' A correspondent using the name Chicorytip wrote: 'Yes, that's the girl. She was a bit crazy in a sweet and funny way. She was a good person. 'I remember her bringing her pet rabbit to the White Cobra bar. RIP.' Despite demands from expatriates, Phnom Penh police have still failed to issue a photo of Green.",

        "summary": "Iceland's presidential residence doesn't have a fence or apparent guards .\nJohn Sutter talks with a magazine editor who visited the residence .\nSutter: The U.S. shouldn't turn the White House into a fortress .\nSome have suggested making its fence taller or creating a secure perimeter .",
        "article": "(CNN) -- On the off chance you've never been to Iceland's version of the White House, here's what that's like, courtesy of Foreign Affairs deputy editor Stuart Reid: . \"There was incredibly little security,\" Reid told me, describing a 2013 visit for an interview with the country's President. \"I took a taxi to the residence, and the taxi pulled up and I was like, 'OK, now what do I do?' And the taxi driver said, 'Oh, I think you just knock on the door' ... I just go up and ring the doorbell. A butler lets me in. \"I think there was one of those metal check-point gates that can lift up -- that was on a road -- but if you really wanted to you could just drive around it on the grass.\" Was there a fence? No. Guards? No. Guns? Nope. And was the door locked? \"I'm not sure whether it was unlocked or locked.\" At this point, you may be thinking Iceland's President is the most naive person in the universe, especially in light of the Secret Service scandal in the United States. But I don't see it that way, and neither does Reid. At a time when the U.S. Congress is lining up to take jabs at the Secret Service, which, among other legitimately scandalous things, failed to stop an intruder from making it into the White House East Room, Iceland's no-security state could be seen as a breath of fresh air -- a reminder, as Reid and others have put it, that the president is supposed to be one of the people. \"This is really what the White House is all about. It's the 'People's House,' \" first lady Michelle Obama says in a statement on the White House website. \"It's a place that is steeped in history, but it's also a place where everyone should feel welcome.\" \"Should\" is the operative word here. I worry such openness won't continue in the wake of this scandal. A number of White House security \"improvements\" have been proposed by Congress, the news media and the public -- from making the fence around the residence taller to blocking off pedestrian traffic around the building. Currently, anyone can walk up to the White House's wrought iron fence and can see the building across a lawn. This is a popular spot both for tourist photos (I've taken them) and protests. Troublingly, 16 people are reported to have made it past the fence in the last five years, including one toddler. \"While the Secret Service considers creating new fences, large buffer zones and checkpoints around the grounds, they are overlooking a simple, cost-effective solution -- bringing in the United States military,\" Dan Emmett, a retired Secret Service agent, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post. The concerns are real. But militarize the White House? I find that shockingly reactionary. Perhaps I shouldn't, though. It is the history. When Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as president in 1829, he famously \"opened up the White House and basically let the rabble in,\" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Thousands of \"people trampled through and they didn't even have to wipe their feet. There were reports about how much dirt they had to sweep out afterward.\" Since then, Engel told me, \"there's no doubt that we have seen a steady increase in the limitations on public access. At this point (the White House) is a fortress.\" There are valid reasons for that. Assassination attempts and security breaches, like those seen this year, are, of course, cause for concern and precaution. But I find it comforting that there are still countries -- including Iceland -- where the president is allowed to remain part of the people. That's a sign of a healthy society. Look, I'm not arguing that the no-one-has-a-gun-and-we-trust-everyone-not-to-shoot-the-president approach that Iceland takes would function in heavily armed America. It wouldn't. Iceland is a country of 320,000 people, which makes it slightly more populous than Anchorage. Its violent crime rate is lower, and there likely are fewer people who would want to assassinate \u00c3\u201clafur Ragnar Gr\u00c3\u00admsson, the country's President. For one, he's super nice (he invited me for pancakes when I interviewed him in Maine in 2011). And he's not the most powerful person in the free world -- or arguably in his country. But -- but! -- as our country investigates the White House security breaches, and demands change, it would be wise of us to remember the White House belongs to the American people. The first family should be made safe, but not by raising fences and creating no-go zones around the perimeter of the people's house. I can imagine a dystopian future in which tourists peer through a thick window of yellowed glass -- like at Sea World or something -- to see the presidential residence from beyond a concrete barrier. I certainly don't want to live in that country. \"In an open society, like the United States, or like Iceland, there's this idea that the president is one of the people. He comes from them and he is accountable to them,\" said Reid, the Foreign Affairs editor. \"It would be a shame, in my opinion, if the Secret Service scandal resulted in closing off more public space in D.C. If you actually wanted to protect the president to a totally 100% degree, you would keep expanding the secure zone around the White House evermore. \"But that would come at some cost to the fact that school kids can peer through the fence and see the White House and dream about being president.\" Great point. Lawmakers and the first family should keep those kids -- those dreamers standing at the White House fence -- at front of mind as they consider reforms.",

        "article": "By . Kimberley Dadds . PUBLISHED: . 20:14 EST, 25 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:36 EST, 27 August 2012 . It was the big news to hit the world of TOWIE on Wednesday when she finally decided to hang up her high heels and leave the show. Lauren Goodger has decided to open up about her decision to leave the reality programme and claims it is not to find her fortune elsewhere, but because of her weight insecurities. Goodger, 25, has revealed that she would feel so body conscious next to other slim cast-mates that she would want to hide parts of her body in front of the cameras. Free from TOWIE: Lauren has opened up about her reasons to leave The Only Way Is Essex, revealing she had enough of feeling insecure about her body on screen . She admits working with her skinny co-stars didn't help her feelings of paranoia. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I felt under so much pressure. Most of the girls on TOWIE are quite skinny... Next to the others, I\u2019d be panicking over whether my arms looked fat or how big I\u2019d look if I was sitting down. 'I\u2019d even beg producers to let me sit at a table so I could hide my legs underneath.' Lauren is now looking forward to 'a break' after constantly struggling with her weight issues since rising to fame on the reality show. Final scenes: She announced during the season six finale on Wednesday that she would be 'going away for a while' Since being put in front of the public eye Goodger has been subjected to internet trolls who have targeted over her fluctuating weight. And she's now had enough of crying her her body issues and being targeted for being on The Only Way Is Essex. She now feels it's the right time to move on after putting herself through the ups and downs of being a TOWIE star. Celebrations: Lauren is now looking forward to her next chapter and wants to stop crying over appearing on the programme and being targeted by internet trolls . Lauren is also feeling more body confident now she is a 'healthy size 12' but hopes to drop a bit of weight in the near future, admitting shed like to drop 'a stone and a half'. Goodger is rumoured to be taking up a role on Dancing On Ice now that she is free from the ITV2 show but she is still remaining tight-lipped about any signings. She told the newspaper that 'nothing's confirmed yet'. But one thing she will shed light on is the fact she's writing a book, although it won't be an autobiography telling all on her life and will instead be a guide about her life - battling with her weight and her relationship problems.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- More than a quarter-million American women served honorably in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. These brave women sacrificed much to keep us safe. Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life. Yet there is mounting evidence that America is not fulfilling this obligation. Based on data gathered by the Veterans Affairs and Defense departments, a recent report by Disabled American Veterans finds it clear that our country isn't fully meeting the unique physical, emotional and employment needs of women who served in uniform. Although they served in equal capacities in combat environments, when they return home they receive less support than their male counterparts from government programs primarily designed for men. Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year. One in 11 is unemployed. Former servicewomen experience homelessness at between two to four times the rate of their civilian counterparts. It's unacceptable that the women who honorably served our country\u00e2\u20ac\u201dour mothers, spouses, sisters and daughters\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare at risk. The DAV report finds that the federal, state and community programs to support women making the transition out of military service have serious gaps that put some of them in jeopardy. Consider medical care. Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health. Mental health services for women are severely lacking. Twenty percent of female patients in the VA health system have been diagnosed with a condition resulting from military sexual trauma, which can have devastating, long-term consequences. Nonetheless, one in three VA health centers does not have enough sexual trauma specialists on staff. Sadly, we are not doing much better when it comes to helping women gain post-military employment. Former servicewomen are highly skilled, with unique life experiences that give them valuable leadership qualities and the know-how to operate effectively in high-stress situations. Yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade, and is now higher than for male veterans. What's more, two-thirds of women report that the career service help offered by federal agencies has been sub-par. These problems could soon get worse. The military has started on a major drawdown of personnel. As a result, more than 200,000 servicewomen are expected to rejoin the civilian workforce in the next five years. Now is the time for action. In our report, \"Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home,\" DAV outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that Congress, the administration, VA and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans. For starters, veterans' health centers must meet their obligation to provide specialists in women's health. At a minimum, every VA medical center must hire a gynecologist. And efforts to treat and help stamp out sexual assault within the military need to be expanded. Officials must intensify their efforts to change any remnants of a culture that comes at the expense of women's dignity and safety. To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program. The department does not collect data on participation, satisfaction, and outcomes by gender and race. Simply put, the Department of Defense cannot tell us if the Transition Assistance Program actually helps female veterans find jobs. Also, the VA and Defense Department need to develop career guidance programs specially designed for women. Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options. Inadequate child care is proving to be a major obstacle for many women transitioning home. For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable. Thousands of women answered the call of duty and put themselves at risk to preserve our nation's security. They served this country faithfully. Serving them with greater respect, consideration and care must become a national priority.",

        "summary": "Alexis Sanchez has eight goals and two assists this season .\nThe Chilean forward signed from Barcelona for \u00a330million .\nArsenal would be on the edge of the relegation zone without Sanchez .",
        "article": "Arsenal would be teetering on the edge of the relegation zone were it not for summer signing Alexis Sanchez. The \u00a330million man brought in from Barcelona has virtually been single-handedly keeping Arsene Wenger's side competitive with his goals and assists this season. Although this has been far from a vintage Arsenal season and they sit sixth in the table, were it not for Sanchez's crucial contribution of eight goals and two assists they would be in 17th on 10 points. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring for Arsenal against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday . Sanchez (centre) scores the opening goal of the match but Arsenal went on to lose 2-1 to Swansea . Alexis Sanchez's stats for 2014-15 . Matches 10 . Goals 8 Minutes per goal 98 . Assists 2 Chances created 24 . Premier League only, stats via Opta . Sanchez has earned them an extra seven points already this campaign. Against Crystal Palace he set up Aaron Ramsey to turn a 1-1 draw into a win and his double against Sunderland secured victory. He scored versus Leicester and Manchester City to salvage a point in both games and earned them one more against Hull by scoring and setting up Danny Welbeck's last-minute equaliser. The Chilean's form is up there with the best, with 12 goals in his last 14 games in all competitions and it appears Wenger has found the goal-scorer he needed. 'His quality is exceptional, he takes responsibility and goes at people. He fights, he can score, that is what you want from great players,' Wenger has said this season. Sanchez (centre) takes on Swansea duo Tom Carroll (left) and Gylfi Sigurdsson during Sunday's match .

After rising between two burly Burnley defenders to head in against them, in their 3-0 win in which he scored twice, Wenger said: \u2018I didn\u2019t count on him in the air at all. 'But I know that in the air it is more about desire and he has that. He is a winner and finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0-0. That\u2019s what is important. 'We are in a job where you can always improve. He is unbelievably keen and every day wants to practise.\u2019 The Frenchman has even compared Sanchez to Luis Suarez, adding: 'There are similarities with Suarez a little bit. By going at you, by being where you do not expect him to be in the box and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things.' Given how Liverpool are so desperately struggling with out the Uruguayan, Wenger will not want to become so reliant on one player. Sanchez is second in the Premier League when it comes to shot conversion rate (stats via Opta) The Chilean is way out in front when it comes to chances created (stats via Opta)",
